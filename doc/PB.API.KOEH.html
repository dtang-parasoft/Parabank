DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Objects which are used as keys in Maps or inserted into Sets generally should 
override the 'equals()' and 'hashCode()' methods.  This rule will flag a 
violation for each case where an object which does not override 'equals()' and/or 
'hashCode()' is inserted into a 'Set' or used as the key in a 'Map'.  The rule 
will check the interface types 'java.util.Map' and 'java.util.Set' as well as the 
concrete implementations of these interfaces 'java.util.HashMap', 'java.util.
HashSet', and 'java.util.Hashtable'.

<PRE>

-Allow the following types as keys in Sets and Maps (Specify fully qualified 
 type names): 
    -Types in this list will be ignored when they are used as keys in Maps or as
     entries in Sets.    
    -This rule may report several violations for types which you know are 
     acceptable to use as entries in Sets or keys in Maps when you first run
     the rule.  To prevent the rule from flagging violations for these key 
     types, you should add the types to this list.
    -By default, this list is empty.  You must add your own values to it.

<PRE>

If an object which does not override 'equals()' and/or 'hashCode()' is used as 
the key in a Map or inserted into a Set, future lookups will likely not behave
as expected.  These lookups will either fail or be inefficient unless the object
that is being looked up is the exact same object as the one that was originally
inserted into the 'Map' or 'Set'.  Usually, this is not what was intended.  
Future lookups should succeed as long as the object being looked up has values
in its fields which are equal to the values in the fields of the object which 
was originally inserted.  This is accomplished by overriding the 'equals()' 
method.  If the 'equals()' method is overridden, the 'hashCode()' method should 
also be overridden.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Note that, since the 'IntWrapper' class does not override the 'equals()' method
or the 'hashCode()' method, the 'main()' method will not find the "IntWrapper" 
object which was inserted into the 'Map'.  Thus, "null" will be printed out.

package examples.rules.pb.api;

import java.util.*;

public class KOEH {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntWrapper iw= new IntWrapper(0);
        Map m= new HashMap();
        m.put(iw, "FOUND");  //VIOLATION
        IntWrapper iw2= new IntWrapper(0);
        System.out.println(m.get(iw2));
    }
    
    private static class IntWrapper {
        private final int _field;
        
        IntWrapper(int a) {
            _field= a;
        }
    }
}

<PRE>

Override the 'equals()' and 'hashCode()' methods so that two 'IntWrapper'
objects will be considered equal (and have the same hash code) as long as their
fields have the same value.  After this is done, the 'main()' method will print
out "FOUND", which is probably what was originally intended.

package examples.rules.pb.api;

import java.util.*;

public class KOEHFixed {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntWrapper iw= new IntWrapper(0);
        Map m= new HashMap();
        m.put(iw, "FOUND");  //FIXED
        IntWrapper iw2= new IntWrapper(0);
        System.out.println(m.get(iw2));
    }
    
    private static class IntWrapper {
        private final int _field;
        
        IntWrapper(int a) {
            _field= a;
        }
        
        public int hashCode() {
            return _field;
        }
        
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            if(!(o instanceof IntWrapper)){
                return false;
            }
            return ((IntWrapper)o)._field == _field;
        }
    }
}
