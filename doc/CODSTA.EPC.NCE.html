DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that uses "catch" on exception types which are either
too general or which are unchecked exception types.  By default, the rule checks 
for "catch" statements where the exception type is too general (either 
'Exception', 'RuntimeException', 'Throwable', or 'Error').  The rule can be 
parameterized to check for "catch" statements where the exception type is an
unchecked exception (any subclass of 'Error' or 'RuntimeException').  An error
is reported for each occurrence. The rule also checks 'IOException' for cases
where it is caught, and the try statement has no possibility of throwing a
general 'IOException'.

category: Unsafe Error Handling and Logging

Following this rule may introduce security problems, as exceptions may be left 
uncaught.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check for general exception types. (default is true)
    -If this parameter is selected, a violation will be flagged for each 
     attempt to catch 'Exception', 'RuntimeException', 'Throwable', or 'Error'.
-Check for unchecked exception types. (default is false)
    -If this parameter is selected, a violation will be flagged for each 
     attempt to catch 'RuntimeException', 'Error', or any subclass of either of
     these types.
-Check for parent exceptions caught where number of child exceptions thrown is 
 less than (default is false, 3)
    -If this parameter is selected, a violation will be flagged for each case
     where a parent exception of types thrown in the try statement is caught and
     the number of child exceptions is less than a specified amount. For example
     if 2 different subclasses of 'IOException' are thrown and the parameter is
     set to 3 then an error will be flagged.
-Ignore exceptions with names matching the following regular expression(s):
    -The rule will not flag a violation if the name of the exception matches one
     of the regular expressions specified in this list.  Matching is not case
     sensitive, so differences in case will be ignored.
    -By default, the list includes "^ignore$", which means that violations will 
     not be flagged for exception variables with the name "ignore".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If you "catch" an exception type which is too general, then your code may 
accidentally "catch" errors that were supposed to be caught (or left uncaught) 
by the caller of the current method.  You should always try to catch the 
specific subclasses of 'Exception' that your code is meant to handle.

Unchecked exception types (any subclasses of 'Error' or 'RuntimeException') 
should not be caught because these exceptions are usually thrown in unexpected
situations.  They generally indicate bugs in the code, so the code should be
fixed instead of catching the exception.  Common examples include 'NullPointer
Exceptions' and 'ClassCastExceptions'.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The example below tries to read from an input stream, and so it should try to
"catch" 'IOException' and deal with it accordingly.

package examples.rules.codsta.epc;

public class NCE {
    void method () {
        try {
            System.in.read();
        }
        catch (Exception e1) {  // VIOLATION
        }
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Deal with subclasses of 'Exception', 'RuntimeException', and 'Throwable'
when handling exceptions.

package examples.rules.codsta;

public class NCEFixed {
    void method () {
        try {
            System.in.read();
        }
        catch (java.io.IOException e1) {  // FIXED
        }
    }
}
