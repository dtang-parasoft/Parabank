BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"switch" statements with many "case" statements make code difficult to follow.  
More importantly, switches with many cases often indicate places where 
polymorphic behavior could better be used to provide different behavior for
different types.  Note that although the general principle is to avoid many 
cases in a switch, the actual cutoff point is arbitrary.

"switch" statements with too few "case" statements may be better represented
as "if"/"else" statements.

Look for cleaner ways to invoke the alternative behaviors.
