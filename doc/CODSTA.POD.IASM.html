DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that static members are not accessed indirectly.  Static 
methods and fields should be accessed using the name of the type in which they 
are declared.

<PRE>

Accessing static members indirectly is poor coding style and can lead to 
confusion.  It may also lead to bugs if new static members with the same names 
as the static members which are indirectly accessed are added to the types 
referenced.  This may cause the access to change so that it is accessing a 
completely different member.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.pod;

public class IASM {
    static class IASM_a
    {
        public static int FOO = 0;
    }

    class IASM_b extends IASM_a
    {
    }

    public int getFoo()
    {
        return IASM_b.FOO;  //VIOLATION
    }
}

Note: If a field "FOO" is added to IASM_b in this code, it will cause the 
"getFoo()" method to access the wrong field.

Access static members using the name of the type in which they are declared.

package examples.rules.codsta.pod;

public class IASMFixed { 
    static class IASM_a
    {
        public static int FOO = 0;
    }

    class IASM_b extends IASM_a
    {
    }

    public int getFoo()
    {
        return IASM_a.FOO;  //FIXED- changed to direct access
    }
}
