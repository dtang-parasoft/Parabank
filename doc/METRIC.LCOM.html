DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This metric calculates Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) as defined by Henderson-Sellers
("LCOM3" or the "LCOM*" variant). Only fields that are accessed by at least one method,
and methods that access at least one field, are included in the count. 
Cohesion is a measure of relatedness in a class. A class with low cohesion means
that it may perform various tasks that have little relation to each other. These classes
may be candidates for refactoring into separate, more targeted, classes. 
LCOM is determined according to the following formula:

LCOM = (avg(m(f)) - m)/(1-m)
- m is the number of methods that use at least one field
- m(f) is the number of methods that use field ‘f’
- avg(m(f)) is the average number of methods that use field f computed over all fields
  that are used by at least one method, 
  thus: avg(m(f)) = (m(f1) + m(f2) + ... + m(fn)) / n

LCOM can take values between 0 and 1, where 0 means class is cohesive (lack of cohesion
is at minimum), and 1 means class is not cohesive (lack of cohesion is at maximum). 
A value of 0 means that the class is cohesive. Every field is used by every method;
and all methods work on the same set of fields and perform common tasks. 
A value of 1 means that the class is not cohesive. Every field is used by only 1 method;
and every method has its own field and performs its own task separate from other methods/tasks.
