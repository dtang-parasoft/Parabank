DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "catch" clauses that only rethrow the exception.
An error is reported for each "catch" block which contains no statements
other than a statement rethrowing the original exception.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v7.5

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1.  This rule will not flag a violation for "catch" clauses which catch Errors
of type "java.lang.ThreadDeath" because it is common practice to catch
"java.lang.ThreadDeath" only to rethrow it.  According to its Javadoc, 
"ThreadDeath" must be rethrown if it is caught.

2.  This rule will also not catch cases where removing the "catch" clause may
change the semantics of the code.  For instance, if a "catch" clause is followed
by a "catch" clause which catches a more general type of exception, no violation
will be flagged because removing the "catch" clause may change the semantics of
the code.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"catch" clauses that only rethrow the exception are meaningless. Removing
them improves code readability and makes code less error-prone.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.usc;

public class RTE {

    public void method() throws Exception {

        try {
            // ... 
        } catch (Exception e) {  // VIOLATION
            throw e;  
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the "try-catch" statement, or do something meaningful with the
exception (such as writing it to the logfile).

package examples.rules.pb.usc;

public RTEFixed {

    public void method() throws Exception {
	  // FIXED : try-catch statement is removed
          // ... 
    }
}
