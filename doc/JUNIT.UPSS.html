DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The signature for the "suite()" method for JUnit test classes should match the
following:

public static Test suite();

With the default settings of the parameters (all options selected), the rule 
will flag a violation if there is a potential typo in the name of the "suite()" 
method or if there is a method which has the name "suite" but which does not 
meet any of the following conditions:

1. The method must be "public".
2. The method must be "static".
3. The method must have 0 parameters.
4. The method must have the return type "junit.framework.Test".

The user can control what is checked by the rule by changing the parameter 
settings.  This rule will only check classes which extend "junit.framework.
TestCase".  

The rule determines if a method name is a potential typo for the "suite()" 
method using the same rules followed by the rule PB.IMO.  That is, it will flag 
a violation if a method signature matches that of the "suite()" method and has 
a name which differs from "suite" by only one character or only in case.  See
the example below.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will only test classes which meet one of the following conditions:

1. The class extends "junit.framework.TestCase".
2. The class has at least one method with the "org.junit.Test" annotation.  This
only applies to JUnit 4.0 and later.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check that the method name does not contain a typo (default is true)
-Check that the method is declared "public" (default is true)
-Check that the method is declared "static" (default is true)
-Check that the method has no parameters (default is true)
-Check that the return type is "junit.framework.Test" (default is true)

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The test runner for JUnit tests expects the "suite()" method defined by a user 
to have the signature shown in the "DESCRIPTION" section.  If the "suite()" 
method does not have this signature, the test runner may be unable to use it.

package examples.rules.junit;

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class UPSS extends TestCase {
    public static Test suitw() {          //VIOLATION- typo: "suitw" should be "suite"
        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();
        suite.addTest(new UPSS());
        return suite;
    }
}

class UPSS_2 extends TestCase {
    public Test suite() {                 //VIOLATION- should be "static"
        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();
        suite.addTest(new UPSS_2());
        return suite;
    }   
}

Make sure the name of the method is spelled correctly and that the signature 
matches that given in the "DESCRIPTION" section above.

package examples.rules.junit;

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class UPSSFixed extends TestCase {
    public static Test suite() {           //FIXED
        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();
        suite.addTest(new UPSSFixed());
        return suite;
    }
}

class UPSS_2Fixed extends TestCase {
    public static Test suite() {           //FIXED
        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();
        suite.addTest(new UPSS_2Fixed());
        return suite;
    }
