Number of Physical Lines metrics measures the total number of lines. It covers all
kinds of lines: source code lines, lines with comments, and blank lines.
This metric counts the number of physical lines that belong to methods.
It includes comments that precede the methods.

Anonymous methods belong to the closest regular (nested or not) methods. In the 'Anonymous methods' example part,
method Bar has 9 lines and no other method is reported:
