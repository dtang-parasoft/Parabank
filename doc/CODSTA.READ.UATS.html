DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule can be set to identify either code that does or does not use "this" 
and "super" for non-static field and method access. An error is reported 
for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There is one exception to this rule.  Sometimes it is impossible to avoid 
using the "super" keyword.  This happens when there is a method or a variable
in a class which has the same name as a method or variable in the superclass.  
In this case, a violation will not be flagged if the "super" keyword is used 
(even if the current setting of the parameters is to avoid use of "super").  It
is always possible to avoid use of the "this" keyword.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Avoid or enforce using 'this' and 'super' expressions.
   By default, this rule is set to report an error if code uses "this" and 
   "super" for non-static field and method access.
-What to Check
   This parameter allows the user to specify whether to check the usage of 
   "super", the usage of "this", or both.  By default, the rule will check usage
   of both "super" and "this".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Whether you want to avoid or require the use of 'this' and 'super' expressions
for non-static field and method access is a matter of personal preference.
When "this" or "super" are used, it could explicitly state the scope of a field 
or a method. Hence, anyone reading the code would get a better sense of 
scopes under this convention. On the other hand, when "this" or "super"
are used, it could imply that local variables and fields are sharing the same 
names. In this situation, anyone reading your code might refer to the wrong
item without using "this" or "super" when it is needed. Using different local
variable and field names could prevent this mistake.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class UATS {
    int a;
    public UATS (int a) {
        a++;
        this.a = a;  //VIOLATION
        this.myMethod(); //VIOLATION 
    }
    public void myMethod () {
    System.out.println("Ctor");
    }    
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Modify the code so that it does not use 'this'.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class UATSFixed {
    int a;
    public UATSFixed (int _a) {
        _a++;
        a = _a;  //FIXED
        myMethod(); //FIXED
    }
    public void myMethod () {
        System.out.println("Ctor");
    }
}
