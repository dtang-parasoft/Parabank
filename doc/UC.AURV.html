DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies unused local variables and local variables which are only
assigned to but are never read.  By default, a violation is flagged for each
declaration of a local variable which is never used.  A violation will also be
flagged by default for variables which are assigned a value (even multiply) but
which are never read later.  A violation will be flagged in this case at the
variable declaration as well as at each place where the variable is assigned to.
An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule replaces two old rules from previous versions of Jtest (UC.AUV and
UC.AVNR) since there was significant overlap between these two rules.
Originally, UC.AUV was designed to flag local variables which are never used at
all, and UC.AVNR was designed to flag local variables which are assigned to but
are never read.  This new rule combines the functionality of these old rules.
If you only want to enforce one part of the rule but not the other, you can
change the values of the parameters to get the original behavior of either
UC.AUV or UC.AVNR.

Currently, a Quick Fix is only available for cases where a local variable is
never used at all.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store. . .
This weakness could be an indication of a bug in the program or a deprecated
variable that was not removed and is an indication of poor quality. This could
lead to further bugs and the introduction of weaknesses." [CWE-563]

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check for variables which are assigned but never read.
    -Default is "true".
    -Enabling this parameter provides the functionality of the deprecated rule
     UC.AVNR.
-Check for variables which are never used.
    -Default is "true".
    -Enabling this parameter provides the functionality of the deprecated rule
     UC.AUV.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An unused or unread variable may indicate a logical flaw in the corresponding
method. In this case, the method should be rewritten to take the unused or
unread variable into account. This revision removes the logical flaw.

The variable could also have accidentally been leftover when its use was
deleted. In this case, it is safe to remove. This revision simplifies code, which
makes it easier to read and less error prone.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public class AURV {
    void method () {
        int i = 4;  // VIOLATION
    }

    static class NodeData {
        //...
    }

    public static boolean needsRefresh(NodeData orig, NodeData update) {
        boolean ret = false;  // VIOLATION: 'ret' is assigned, but not read

        if (orig == null &amp;&amp; update != null) {
            ret = true;
        } else if (orig != null &amp;&amp; update == null) {
            ret = true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Either add the missing usage of the variable or remove the variable.

package examples.rules.uc;

public class AURVFixed {
    void method () {
        // FIXED
    }

    static class NodeData {
        //...
    }

    public static boolean needsRefresh(NodeData orig, NodeData update) {
        boolean ret = false;

        if (orig == null &amp;&amp; update != null) {
            ret = true;
        } else if (orig != null &amp;&amp; update == null) {
            ret = true;
        }

        return ret;  // FIXED: variable 'ret' is used as intended
    }
}
