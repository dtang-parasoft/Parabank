DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies 'set' and 'get' methods that do not access or set  
the intended instance fields. An error is reported when a method
is named "setX" or "getX", but does not actually access or set field "X".

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Because there may be different naming conventions for fields, this rule
will ignore any characters other than letters and digits when matching field 
names.

If a "set" method calls another method, this rule will search the called
method to see if it sets the intended instance field.  It will search up
to a depth of three method calls.  A special case is if the called method 
is declared as "abstract" and the name of the method matches the 
convention for a "set" method for the intended field (e.g., "setX()" for 
field "x").  In this case, no violation will be reported since it cannot 
be determined statically whether this method actually sets the intended 
field.  

It is also impossible to determine statically whether or not a "set" method 
sets the intended field if the field is not primitive and the "set" method 
passes that field as a parameter to another method.  For this reason, the 
rule will not report any violations for "set" methods which pass the field
as a parameter to another method.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check 'set' methods (default is true)
    -Ignore 'set' methods which throw an exception (default is false)
    Some methods may throw an exception, which may also represent a valid
    behavior. For example, a method may throw UnsupportedOperationException
    if it is not yet implemented or it is unintended for the field to be
    accessed.
-Check 'get' methods (default is true)
    -Ignore 'get' methods which throw an exception (default is false)


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By method naming convention, if a method is named "setX" or "getX", then it
should set or get the value of instance field with name X. If the method is 
actually setting or getting other instance fields, then it might indicate a
possible bug.
