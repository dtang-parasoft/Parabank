DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that does not apply the "synchronized" modifier
to the 'run ()' method of a class that implements the 'Runnable' "interface".
An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Quickfix All" feature is not available for this rule because there are some
cases where it is not desirable to fix the violation (See the DRAWBACKS section). 
The user should go through each violation separately and decide whether the 
quickfix should be used.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore methods with "@concurrency" tag values of "concurrent" or "sequential"
    (default true)
    Methods with the Design by Contract tag "@concurrency" are assumed to have
    been analyzed and marked accordingly. Therefore, those with a value of
    "concurrent" or "sequential" are ignored.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The 'run ()' method should be "synchronized" if it cannot be safely executed
concurrently.  Multiple threads can be started for the same object implementing
the Runnable interface and the method 'run ()' can be executed concurrently.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If the body of the 'run ()' method can be safely executed concurrently, then 
the method should NOT be "synchronized".  Declaring the method as
"synchronized" will slow down the program.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.trs;

public class RUN implements Runnable {
    public void run () {  // VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declare the 'run ()' method "synchronized".

package examples.rules.trs;

public class RUNFixed implements Runnable {
    public synchronized void run () {
    }
}
