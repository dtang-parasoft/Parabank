DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>


This rule identifies any type(class/interface/enum/annotation) that has the same name as the file,
but is not the first type(class/interface/enum/annotation) in the file.
An error is reported for each occurrence.

<PRE>

Although inner classes could have same name as the file, they are not
reported as errors.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is good practice to make the first type(class/interface/enum/annotation) in the file
be the type(class/interface/enum/annotation) with the same name as the file.
