DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Integer literals beginning with a "0" are interpreted as octal literals.  This 
rule will flag all cases where octal literals (literals beginning with a "0") are
used.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There is very rarely any reason to use octal literals in a Java program.  Octal 
literals are often used by accident when the programmer adds an extra "0" to the
beginning of an integer literal for padding.  This can lead to unexpected bugs.  
Even if octal literals are used intentionally, it is probably not a good idea
because it makes the code confusing for anyone who has to read it.  If there is 
any way to avoid using octal literals, they should be avoided.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This program looks like it should print out "value = 12", but it prints out 
"value = 10" because "012" is the octal equivalent of decimal "10".
  
package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class UOL {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int value = 012;  //VIOLATION
        System.out.println("value = "+value);
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove any leading "0"'s to make the octal literal a decimal literal if the 
literal was accidentally made an octal literal. 

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class UOLFixed {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int value = 12;  //FIXED
        System.out.println("value = "+value);
    }
}
