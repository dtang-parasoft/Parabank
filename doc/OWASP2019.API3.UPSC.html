Use "PreparedStatements" correctly [OWASP2019.API3.UPSC]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

When using "java.sql.PreparedStatement", the "PreparedStatement" is first 
created using one of the 'prepareStatement()' methods of "java.sql.Connection".  
Then, various 'set...()' methods are called on the "PreparedStatement" to fill 
in the arguments represented by ?'s in the original query String.  This rule 
checks that these 'set' methods are called correctly and that they are called in
the correct order.  This rule checks the following cases:

1.  The number of calls to 'set' methods must match the number of ?'s in the 
query String.  If the number of calls to 'set' methods does not match the number
of ?'s, this is a bug.  

2.  No ?'s in query string. If the query string in "PreparedStatement" didn't have
?'s, it will be considered as a bug in the query string.

3.  The first argument to each 'set' method call must be a valid index.  That 
is, the argument must be greater than or equal to 1, and it must be less than or 
equal to the number of ?'s in the query String for the 'PreparedStatement'.  If 
the first argument to one of the 'set' methods is less than 1 or greater than 
the number of ?'s, this is a bug.

4.  The 'set' methods should be called in the correct order.  That is, the 'set'
method with index 1 should be called first, the set method with index 2 should 
be called next, and so on.  While it is not necessarily a bug to call the 'set' 
methods in the incorrect order, it is poor coding practice and can easily lead 
to bugs.

This rule will flag a violation when any of the rules listed above is violated.

NOTES

<PRE>

The rule only works when the query String used to create the "PreparedStatement"
is a constant String that does not contain any non-"final" variables.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Erratic Application Behavior

This rule will catch several bugs related to the use of "PreparedStatements" 
which can cause your application to fail.  Using "PreparedStatements" 
incorrectly can also cause sensitive data to be accidentally exposed to the 
user.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps to catch many common bugs when using "java.sql.
PreparedStatement".


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are 2 violations in the example shown below.  The first violation is that
no 'set' method with index 2 is called on the first "PreparedStatement".  The 
second violation is that the 'setString()' method is called with an invalid 
index (4) on the second "PreparedStatement".  In the second "PreparedStatement",
there are only 3 parameters, so 4 is not a valid index.

package examples.rules.jdbc;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class UPSC {
    public ResultSet preparedStatementTest(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(
            "select * from A where id = ? and name = ? and choice = ?");  //VIOLATION - 
                                //missing call to 'set' method with index 2
        pstmt.setInt(1, 12);
        pstmt.setString(3, "jtest");  
        ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
        
        pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(
            "select name from A where id = ? and company = ? and choice = ?");
        pstmt.setInt(1, 12);
        pstmt.setString(2, "Parasoft");
        pstmt.setString(4, "jtest");  //VIOLATION - index should be 3, not 4
        return pstmt.executeQuery();
    }
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Add any missing calls to the 'set' methods, or fix the indices so that they are
valid indices.

package examples.rules.jdbc;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class UPSC_Fixed {
    public ResultSet preparedStatementTest(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement("select * from A where id = ? and name = ? " +
            "and choice = ?");  
        pstmt.setInt(1, 12);
        pstmt.setString(2, "Joe");  //FIXED - added a call to 'setString()' with
                                    //index 2
        pstmt.setString(3, "jtest");  
        ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
        
        pstmt = connection.prepareStatement("select name from A where id = ? and company = ? " +
            "and choice = ?");
        pstmt.setInt(1, 12);
        pstmt.setString(2, "Parasoft");
        pstmt.setString(3, "jtest");  //FIXED - changed the index to 3
        return pstmt.executeQuery();
    }
}
