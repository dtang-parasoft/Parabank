Close input and output resources in "finally" blocks [CERT.FIO04.CIO]
</STRONG>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Input and output resources should be created in a "try" block and closed in
a corresponding "finally" block. An error is reported if a local input or 
output stream object is created but is not closed in the "finally" block (or 
there is no corresponding "finally" block).  

This rule will not report a violation for fields which are I/O resources or for
local variables another field depends on. Closing a field which is an I/O 
resource or a local variable another field depends on is likely to break the code,
as other methods will depend on these open I/O resources.

<PRE>

-Ignored types (Specify fully qualified names)
   -The rule will not report any errors for the types specified on the following list.
   -The default listed types are:
       -java.io.ByteArrayInputStream
       -java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
       -java.io.CharArrayWriter
       -java.io.StringBufferInputStream
       -java.io.StringReader
       -java.io.StringWriter
    Objects of these types are not checked because it is guaranteed by the Javadoc
    that the "close()" method for all these classes except "java.io.StringReader"
    will have no effect. Although it is not specified by the Javadoc for
    "java.io.StringReader", failure to close a StringReader object also will not 
    cause a resource leak.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, therefore optimizations are especially important. 

If close() is not called to release the input or output stream before the method returns,
it may cause a resource leak. 

Ensure that your code is structured to close and release input or output resources
in all cases-- even in exception and error conditions. When the close statement is
included in a finally block, the resource will always be closed.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.opt;

public class CIO {
    public void method(java.io.File f) {
        java.io.FileInputStream fis = null;
        try {
            fis = new java.io.FileInputStream(f);
            fis.read();
            fis.close();
        } catch (java.io.FileNotFoundException e1) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        } catch (java.io.IOException e2) {
            System.out.println("I/O Exception");
        }
        // VIOLATION: 'fis.close()' is missing
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Ensure that all input and output resources are closed regardless of any 
exceptions which may be thrown. 
If there already is a "try" block where the I/O resources are being used, add
a "finally" block after the last "catch" that closes all open I/O resources.

If the I/O resource is not used in a "try" block, consider moving it into 
a "try" block if there is any possibility that the code that uses that resource
will throw an exception. As a result, the resource will be closed in a "finally"
block which will be executed regardless of whether or not an exception is thrown.


package examples.rules.opt;

public class CIOFixed {
    public void method(java.io.File f) {
        java.io.FileInputStream fis = null;
        try {
            fis = new java.io.FileInputStream(f);
            fis.read();
        } catch (java.io.FileNotFoundException e1) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        } catch (java.io.IOException e2) {
            System.out.println("I/O Exception");
        } finally {
            if (fis != null) {
                try {
                    fis.close(); // FIXED
                } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
                    System.out.println("I/O Exception");
                }
            }
        }
