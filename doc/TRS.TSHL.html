DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>


The 'Thread.sleep()' methods should not be called when a lock is held.  This rule
will flag a violation for each call to 'Thread.sleep()' from within a 
"synchronized" method or a "synchronized" block.  



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v8.1



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Before fixing each violation of this rule, you should ensure that replacing the 
call to 'Thread.sleep()' with a call to 'wait()' is appropriate.  When the call to
'Thread.sleep()' is made, it may not yet be safe to release the lock that is held
by the current thread.  You should ensure that releasing the lock and allowing 
another thread to run in the "synchronized" method or section of code is safe 
before fixing any violations.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

Calling 'Thread.sleep()' when a lock is held can easily lead to deadlocks; therefore,
you should be careful about calling this method while holding a lock.  Secure 
applications should avoid situations which can lead to deadlocks.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Calling 'Thread.sleep()' when a lock is held can result in poor performance and 
scalability as well as deadlocks.  This is because other threads may be waiting to 
acquire the lock held by the method that calls 'Thread.sleep()'.  The 'Thread.
sleep()' methods do not release the lock.  Calling 'wait()' instead of 'Thread.
sleep()', on the other hand, will release the lock and allow the other threads to 
run.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.trs;

public class TSHL {
    static TSHL _TSHLField= new TSHL();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Waiter waiter= _TSHLField.new Waiter();
        new Thread(waiter).start();
        new Thread(waiter).start();
    }
    
    class Waiter implements Runnable {

        public void run() {
            sleepMethod(1000);
        }   
    }
    
    public synchronized void sleepMethod (long timeToWait) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(timeToWait);  //VIOLATION
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            // ignore exception
        }
    }
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Call 'wait()' in a loop which tests the liveness condition instead of calling 
'Thread.sleep()'.  If you do not understand why 'wait()' must be called in a loop, 
see the rule TRS.UWIL and its documentation.  Calling 'wait()' instead of 
'Thread.sleep()' will release the lock that the first thread holds so that the 
second thread can enter the 'sleepMethod()' method while the first thread is 
waiting.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class TSHLFixed {
    static TSHLFixed _TSHLField= new TSHLFixed();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Waiter waiter= _TSHLField.new Waiter();
        new Thread(waiter).start();
        new Thread(waiter).start();
    }
    
    class Waiter implements Runnable {

        public void run() {
            sleepMethod(1000);
        }   
    }
    
    public synchronized void sleepMethod(long timeToWait) {
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis() + timeToWait;
        long remainingTime = timeToWait;
        while (remainingTime &gt; 0) {
            try {
                wait(remainingTime);  //FIXED 
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                // ignore exception
            }
            remainingTime = end - System.currentTimeMillis();
        }
    }
