Define get and set methods for each instance field [BEAN.NFM]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies instance fields that do not have get and set methods 
defined.  The bean container interacts with the bean mainly through reflection.  
Beans must provide getter and setter methods for each of their properties to 
make them accessible by the bean container.

An error is reported if any of the following conditions are true:

1. The JavaBean class doesn't have a getter and setter method for a field.
2. The getter return type is different than the field type.
3. The setter argument type is different than the field type.
4. The setter return type is not void.
5. The getter or setter method is not a public instance method.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Violations will not be flagged for "transient" fields.  These fields are not 
part of a JavaBean class' persistent state, so they should not have a getter nor
a setter method.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Weak Security Controls
category: Data Security

Great care must be taken that no confidential information is exposed by fixing 
violations of this rule. Certain private fields may contain sensitive data 
(passwords, for example) that is not intended to be publicly accessible. In 
those cases, the affected field should be added to the ignore list (see 
PARAMETERS) or the violation should be suppressed.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore fields with names
 This parameter is a list of field names for which no setter or getter methods 
 should be provided. No violations will be flagged for fields whose names are on 
 this list.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

JavaBean classes are supposed to have get and set methods for all of their 
fields.  If a field in a JavaBean class does not have a proper get or set
method, the code will probably not work correctly.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.bean;

public class NFM {

    private String str;
    private int index;

    public void setStr(String s) {
        str = s;
    }

    // VIOLATION : missing getStr()

    // VIOLATION : missing setIndex()

    public int getIndex() {
        return index;
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
    
Add the missing getter and setter methods.

package examples.rules.bean;

public class NFMFixed {

    private String str;
    private int index;

    public void setStr(String s) {
        str = s;
    }

    public String getStr() {  // FIXED
        return str;
    }

    public void setIndex(int i) {  // FIXED
        index = i;
    }

    public int getIndex() {
        return index;
    }

}
