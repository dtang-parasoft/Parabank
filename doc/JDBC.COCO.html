DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The program does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is
made available for re-use." [CWE-404]

This rule checks that JDBC Objects are closed in the correct order.  Statements
should be closed only after all ResultSets created from that Statement are 
closed.  Connections should be closed only after all Statements created from 
that Connection are closed.  Thus, the standard order in which JDBC Objects are 
closed (when the Objects depend on each other) is as follows:

1.  ResultSets
2.  Statements
3.  Connections

A violation will be flagged for each case where a Statement is closed after a
Connection that was used to create that Statement or where a ResultSet is closed 
after a Statement that was used to create that ResultSet.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability
problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak,
the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting
the resource pool.
When a resource containing sensitive information is not correctly shutdown,
it may expose the sensitive data in a subsequent allocation." [CWE-404]

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If JDBC objects are closed in a different order than the order given above, it 
is likely a bug.  It doesn't make sense to close a Connection before all the 
Statements created from that Connection are closed.  It also doesn't make sense 
to close a Statement before all the ResultSets created from that Statement are 
closed.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.jdbc;

import java.sql.*;
    
public class COCO {
    public void method() {
        try {
            Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:Database");
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Cust");

            // Close the result set, statement and the connection
            conn.close();
            stmt.close();  //VIOLATION- Statement closed after Connection
            rs.close();    //VIOLATION- ResultSet closed after Statement
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
    }
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

Close JDBC Objects in the order shown above: ResultSets then Statements then
Connections.

package examples.rules.jdbc;

import java.sql.*;
    
public class COCOFixed {
    public void method() {
        try {
            Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:Database");
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Cust");

            // Close the result set, statement and the connection
            rs.close();    //FIXED
            stmt.close();  //FIXED   
            conn.close();   
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
    }
