DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Logging methods which may take a long time should only be called if necessary.
For this reason, you should always check the logging level before calling a 
logging method if there are other method calls within the logging method's 
arguments.  Since the method arguments are evaluated regardless of whether or 
not anything gets logged, checking the logging level before calling a logging
method can save unnecessary method calls and improve the program's efficiency.

By default, this rule will check for calls to the logging methods of "java.util.
logging.Logger", and "org.apache.commons.logging.Log",
"org.apache.log4j.Category"/ "org.apache.log4j.Logger" which have other method
calls nested within the logging method calls and which are not protected by an
"if" statement that checks the logging level.  Additional logging methods and
methods to check the logging level can be specified in the parameters.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Sometimes it may be unnecessary to change the code for violations of this rule
because the method calls which are nested within the calls to the logging method
may not be expensive operations.  In this case, the violation should be 
suppressed.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Logging levels to check
    -You may wish to only enforce this rule for calls to logging methods where
     the logging level is at certain levels.  For instance, there usually is no
     need to check the logging level before calling the "fatal()" method of 
     "org.apache.log4j.Category" since the logging level will almost always be
     low enough that "FATAL" messages will be logged.  The same applies for the 
     "SEVERE" Level of "java.util.logging.Logger".  This is why "SEVERE" and 
     "FATAL" are not checked by default.
    -If the rule cannot determine the logging level of a call to a logging 
     method (for instance, if this level is stored in a variable), it will not 
     flag a violation unless the method is specified on the "Customized logging 
     systems" tab.
    
    -Apache Log and Log4j logging Levels which require checking
        -FATAL (Default is "false".)
        -ERROR (Default is "true".)
        -WARN (Default is "true".)
        -INFO (Default is "true".)
        -DEBUG (Default is "true".)
        -TRACE (Default is "true".)
        
    -java.util.logging Levels which require checking
        -SEVERE (Default is "false".)
        -WARNING (Default is "true".)
        -INFO (Default is "true".)
        -CONFIG (Default is "true".)
        -FINE (Default is "true".)
        -FINER (Default is "true".)
        -FINEST (Default is "true".)
        
-Customized logging systems
    -If you use a logging system other than "Log4j" and "java.util.logging", you 
     should specify your own custom methods for checking the level of a logger 
     and doing the actual logging here.  This tab allows the rule to work with
     any logging system.
    -Calls to the logging methods specified in the "Logging Methods to be 
     Checked" list must be enclosed within an "if" statement which checks the 
     logging level using one of the methods specified in the "Level Checking 
     Methods" parameter.
     
    -Level Checking Methods (in form of &lt;regular expression for fully qualified 
     type&gt;#&lt;regular expression for method name&gt;)
        -By default, this list is empty.
        -Example: To add the method "debug()" in the class "examples.rules.opt.
         CLL" to this parameter list, you could enter "^examples\.rules\.opt\.
         CLL$#^debug$" (or simply "examples.rules.opt.CLL#debug").
        
    -Logging Methods to be Checked (in form of &lt;regular expression for fully 
     qualified type&gt;#&lt;regular expression for method name&gt;)
        -By default, this list is empty.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, optimizations are especially important. 

Checking the logging level before calling logging methods can improve the 
program's efficiency if there are expensive method calls nested within the calls
to the logging method.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This example shows a violation of this rule using both the log4j Logger and the
Logger in the "java.util.logging" package.

package examples.rules.opt;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

public class CLL {
    static Logger log4j_logger = Logger.getLogger(CLL.class);
    static java.util.logging.Logger java_util_logger = java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(
            CLL.class.getName());
            
    public void logMethod() {
        log4j_logger.debug("Debug message " + print());  //VIOLATION- The "print()"
                   //method does not need to be called unless the logging level
                   //is set to "DEBUG" or higher.
        java_util_logger.finest("Finest message " + print());  //VIOLATION- The "print()"
                   //method does not need to be called unless the logging level
                   //is set to "FINEST".
    }
    
    /*
     * The "print()" method is expensive because it calls "wait(100000)" and
     * should only be called if absolutely necessary.
     */
    private String print() {
        try {
            wait(100000);
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
            //Ignore exception.
        }
        
        return "foo";
    }    
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Check the logging level before calling any logging methods if the method 
arguments contain expensive method calls.

package examples.rules.opt;

import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

public class CLLFixed {
    static Logger log4j_logger = Logger.getLogger(CLL.class);
    static java.util.logging.Logger java_util_logger = java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(
            CLLFixed.class.getName());
            
    public void logMethod() {
        Level level= log4j_logger.getLevel();
        if(level.isGreaterOrEqual(Level.DEBUG)){  //FIXED
            log4j_logger.debug("Debug message " + print());
        }
        if(java_util_logger.isLoggable(java.util.logging.Level.FINEST)){  //FIXED
            java_util_logger.finest("Finest message " + print()); 
        }
    }
    
    /*
     * The "print()" method is expensive because it calls "wait(100000)" and
     * should only be called if absolutely necessary.
     */
    private String print() {
        try {
            wait(100000);
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
            //Ignore exception.
        }
        
        return "foo";
    }  
}
