DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Arbitrary data (such as data from external sources) should not be considered
safe to log into a file. Such data should be filtered or, preferably,
converted to hex values before logging.
This rule detects when unvalidated binary data is passed to a logging method.

The rule must be parameterized with a list of logging and validating
methods.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Validating methods" parameter allows you to specify methods that can
convert binary data to safe values By default, the return values of
the following methods are considered to be safe:
- the "encode(byte[] )" method of com.google.common.io.BaseEncoding type
- the "toHexString(byte )" method of type java.lang.Integer type

Fill in the following columns to configure additional methods.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the validating method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a validating method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.
- "Returns validated data" - if enabled, the method cleans its return value.
- "Validated parameters" - specifies which method parameters are cleaned by
    the method. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all method parameters are cleaned.

The "Logging methods" parameter allows you to specify logging methods.
The rule triggers when binary data is passed as a parameter to one of
these methods. By default, the parameters of the following methods are
considered to be dangerous:
- the "*log*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*info*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*warn*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*error*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type

Fill in the following columns to configure additional methods.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the logging method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a logging method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.
- "Dangerous parameters" - specifies which method parameters are dangerous.
    List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or use "*" to
    specify that all method parameters are cleaned.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Logging binary data directly as a sting may result in incomplete log files
due to string termination.
This rule helps you ensure that your log files contain the expected data.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers a violation:

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Example
{
    private Logger logger;

    public void messageReceived(InputStream is)
        throws IOException
    {
        byte[] bytes = IOUtils.toByteArray(is);
        logger.info("Message Received: " + new String(bytes)); // VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Convert array of bytes to hex value using validation method.

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Repair
{
    private Logger logger;

    public void messageReceived(InputStream is)
        throws IOException
    {
        byte[] bytes = IOUtils.toByteArray(is);
        logger.info("Message Received: " + BaseEncoding.base16().encode(bytes)); // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
