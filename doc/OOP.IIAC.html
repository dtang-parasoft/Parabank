DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Interfaces should not be implemented just so that constants can be accessed 
without having to use their qualified names (the name of the interface
followed by a "." and the name of the constant).  While it is common practice to
do this, it is confusing and not recommended.  This rule will flag a violation 
for each interface that is implemented which defines (or inherits) at least one 
constant field but does not define (or inherit) any methods.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is similar to the rule 'CODSTA.ISACF: Do not use an "interface" to 
define constants', but the two rules are different.  While CODSTA.ISACF enforces 
that you not define constants in interfaces at all, this rule enforces that you 
not implement interfaces solely to access constants.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Implementing an interface usually implies that you're providing a concrete 
implementation for some general type.  This means that there should be at least 
one method defined (or inherited) for each interface that is implemented.  If an
interface which defines only constant fields is implemented, there is no 
concrete implementation required.  Since readers of the code expect implemented 
interfaces to provide some concrete implementation, this may be confusing.

<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Implementing an interface to access constants allows the constants to be 
accessed without using their qualified names.  This makes the code more compact,
but this benefit comes at the expense of making the code more confusing.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Here, the interface "INameConstant" does not define any methods.  It is 
implemented solely to allow access to the constant "NAME" without using the
qualified name.

package examples.rules.oop;

public class IIAC implements INameConstant {  //VIOLATION
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("My name is " + NAME);
    }
}

interface INameConstant {
    String NAME = "Steve";
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

Do not implement interfaces just to access constants.  Use the qualified name to
access these constants instead.

package examples.rules.oop;

public class IIACFixed { 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("My name is " + INameConstant.NAME);  //FIXED
    }
}

interface INameConstant {
    String NAME = "Steve";
}
