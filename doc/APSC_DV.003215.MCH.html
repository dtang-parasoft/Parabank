DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is a good practice to document code by adding comments to provide
information that is not available in the code itself. For example,
file header comments can provide general information about the file
as a whole, such as the date of creation, the name of the author, 
a brief description of the code the file includes, etc. 

This rule detects source files that do not include appropriate file
header comments.

The rule must be parameterized to specify the comments the rule will assume
to be acceptable (see PARAMETERS).

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The following parameters allow you to define acceptable file header comments.

-File header location: - specifies the acceptable file header comment location.
    - before package declaration (if any) (enabled by default)
    - after package declaration (if any)

-File header format: - specifies the pattern of comments the rule will enforce.
	- Match the file header with the following template (defined in regular
      expressions): (enabled by default) - if enabled, the rule triggers when
         a file does not include a header comment that matches the template
         specified in the field below (in regular expressions). When defining
         the template, skip the comment characters (such as "//", "/**", etc.)
         and mark empty lines in regular expressions (for example, with "\s*").
    - Match case sensitive - if enabled, the rule checks case sensitivity when
         comparing file header comments against the template.
    - Trim header lines (enabled by default)- if enabled, the rule ignores
         white spaces at the beginning and end of file header comments when
         comparing the comments against the template.

-Acceptable types of comments: - specifies acceptable types of comments.
    - C-Style comments (enabled by default) - if enabled, C-style comments
     are accepted. C-style comments, which begin with "/*" and end with "*/",
     are the standard type of comments used in file headers. 
    - Javadoc comments (enabled by default) - if enabled, Javadoc comments are
     accepted. Javadoc comments begin with "/**" and end with "*/".
    - Single-line comments  - if enabled, single-line comments, where each line
	 begins with "//", are accepted.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule allows you to enforce a common convention of documenting code in
file header comments. This can help you improve code readability and facilitate
the code development process.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the file header comment is missing.

package examples.rules.format; // VIOLATION

public class MCH {  

}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, add a file header comment before the package declaration.

/*
 * This comment provides general information about the class.  // FIXED
 */

package examples.rules.format;

public class MCHFixed { 
}
