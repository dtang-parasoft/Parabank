DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This metric calculates the sum of Strict Cyclomatic Complexity (see METRIC.SCC)
of methods of a class.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

The weighted methods of class (WMC) metric is the sum of the complexities
of all type methods where the number of methods and the complexity of the methods
involved is a predictor of how much time and effort is required to develop
and maintain the type. WMC measures usability and reusability via strict cyclomatic
complexities by summing METRIC.SCC of the declared methods and constructors of type.
A type with a low WMC usually points to greater polymorphism, while a type with a high WMC
indicates that the type is complex and therefore harder to reuse and maintain.

Metric  Code
        
        class Foo
        {
+1          String Bar(int i, int j, int k)
            {
                String str = null;
+1              if (i &gt;= 2)
                {
+2                  if (j &gt; 4 &amp;&amp; k &lt; 3)
                    {
                        str = "correct";
                    }
                }
+1              if (j &gt; 10)
                {
                    return "out of range";
                }
                return str;
            }
 
+1          String Qux(int i)
            {
                String str = null;
                switch (i)
                {
+1                  case 0:
                        return "nothing";
+1                  case 1:
                        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
                }
                return str;
            }
        }
