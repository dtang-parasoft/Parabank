BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Fields and methods that share the same name as their enclosing class can lead
to confusion. In the case of methods, it may even be an error as the method may
have been intended to be a constructor instead. Fields that share the same name
as a member method can also cause confusion as to whether a member field or
method is attempting to be accessed.
