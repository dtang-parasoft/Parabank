Do not open or close JDBC connections in loops [JDBC.ODBIL]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that database connections are opened or closed inside loop
bodies.  By default, the connection opening method is "getConnection()" in "java.
sql.DriverManager", and the connection closing method is "close()" in "java.sql.
Connection".  More opening and closing methods can be specified in the parameters.
A violation is reported for each occurrence.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability
problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak,
the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting
the resource pool.
When a resource containing sensitive information is not correctly shutdown,
it may expose the sensitive data in a subsequent allocation." [CWE-404]

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Maximum level of checking allowed (default is 1)
   This parameter controls the maximum depth of testing. The default of 1
   is usually sufficient; this will prompt Jtest to check for opening and closing
   connections within a depth of 1 function calls. However, you may need to customize
   this parameter if you are testing custom "close()" methods that you have created. If
   you use a custom myOwnCloseResources() method instead of directly calling close(),
   Jtest needs to trace into that method to check the closing. If the close is behind
   more than 1 function calls, the code should be redesigned to reduce complexity, or
   this parameter should be modified.

-Additional JDBC connection opening methods (in regular expression) (Default is empty list.)
   Methods in this list would be considered as valid JDBC connection opening
   methods for the arguments they receive. Methods should only be added to
   this list when their source code is not available.

-Additional JDBC connection closing methods (in regular expression) (Default is empty list.)
   Methods in this list would be considered as valid JDBC connection closing
   methods for the arguments they receive. Methods should only be added to
   this list when their source code is not available.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is inefficient to continually open and close a connection within a loop.
Instead of doing this, the connection should be opened and closed outside of
any loops so that it only has to be opened and closed once.

                Statement stmt= conn.createStatement();
                stmt.executeQuery("some SQL query");
