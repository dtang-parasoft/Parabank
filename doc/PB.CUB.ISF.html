DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "private" non-"final" fields that are meant to be instance 
fields but are declared as "static" by mistake. 

The rule considers any "static" field which meets the following criteria to be
an instance field which may have been mistakenly declared "static":

1.  The field is assigned by either a constructor or a non-"static" initializer.

2.  The field is never accessed in a "static" context.  That is, it is never 
accessed using the name of its declaring type or using its unqualified name in a 
"static" method or "static" initializer.  

3.  The field is accessed at least once in a non-"static" context somewhere in 
the declaring class.  That is, it is accessed using an instance of the declaring 
class, using the "this" keyword, or using its unqualified name in a non-"static" 
method.

<PRE>

If any instance field is mistakenly declared as "static", then all the instances 
of the same type would share the same field instead of their own unique ones.  
This may not have been what was intended.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class ISF {
    private static String _id; //VIOLATION
   
    public ISF(String id) {
        _id= id;
    }
    
    public String getId() {
        return _id;
    }
    
    public void setId(String newId) {
        _id= newId;
    }
}

Inspect the static field and decide if it is meant to be an instance field 
instead.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class ISF_Fixed {
    private String _id; //FIXED
   
    public ISF_Fixed(String id) {
        _id= id;
    }
    
    public String getId() {
        return _id;
    }
    
    public void setId(String newId) {
        _id= newId;
    }
}
