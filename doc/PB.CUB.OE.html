DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies suspicious octal escapes in String literals. Octal
escapes are defined as OctalDigit OR OctalDigit OctalDigit 
OR ZeroToThree OctalDigit OctalDigit, where OctalDigit is 
[0-7]. An error is reported for each occurrence.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

When code includes an octal escape sequence that is followed by a non 
OctalDigit or an octal escape sequence that is longer than
3 Digits, the compiler might interpret it differently than the developer
expects. Restructuring the escape sequence (see example) would not change
the code semantics; however, would make the code more readable and 
less confusing.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class OE {
    public void myMethod() {
	System.out.println("\218 . Do something"); //VIOLATION
        //developers might think \218 is an escape sequence;
        //but actually, it is an escape sequence \21 then followed
        //by string "8 . Do something"
    }
}
