DESCRIPTION

<PRE>
Ensure that files do not contain cyclical dependencies [GLOBAL.ACD-4]  

 DESCRIPTION  
Object-oriented programming experts recommend that you avoid cyclical (or 
"circular") dependencies.  In particular, the experts at Object Mentor (see the 
REFERENCES section) recommend that you follow the "Acyclic Dependencies 
Principle: The dependency structure between packages must be a directed acyclic 
graph (DAG).  That is, there must be no cycles in the dependency structure."  
This rule will help to enforce the Acyclic Dependencies Principle.

Eclipse will check for cyclical dependencies between projects, but it will not
catch cyclical dependencies within the same project.  That is, it will not catch
cases where class A imports class B and class B, in turn, imports class A 
(unless class B and class A are in different projects).  This rule will catch 
cases like this where there are cyclical dependencies in the import statements
of files within the same project.  


The rule reports a violation for every file in the shortest import cycle. Fixing
a violation in any file in a cycle will resolve violations reported for other files
in the same cycle.
The number of violations reported on one file is equal to the number of imports
that lead to cyclical dependencies between classes.

<PRE>
-Maximum Depth of Cyclical Dependencies to Detect:
    -Default value is "5".
    -This rule would take a long time to run if it was required to find cycles
     of an unlimited depth.  Because of this, the rule restricts the depth of
     analysis to 5 files by default.  A depth of analysis of 5 should be enough
     to catch most cycles.  If you find that the rule is missing some cases,
     you may want to experiment with increasing the value of this parameter to
     see if that helps.

BENEFITS

<PRE>
Eliminating cycles in the dependency structure of a project reduces the number
of files upon which each class depends.  This means that changes in one file 
only affect a limited number of other files.  If there are cycles in the 
dependency structure of a project, it is very easy to run into a situation where
every file depends upon every other file in the project.  This means that, every
time one class in the project changes, every other file in the project must 
change to adapt to the change.  Obviously, this will make the project very 
unstable.  Following the Acyclic Dependencies Principle will improve the 
stability of the project.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
File 'ACD.java' in package 'examples.rules.global':

package examples.rules.global;

import examples.rules.global.other_package.ACD_Subclass;

public class ACD {
    public void method(ACD_Subclass ACD_obj) {
        ACD_obj.method();
    }
}

File 'ACD_Subclass.java' in package 'examples.rules.global.other_package':

package examples.rules.global.other_package;

import examples.rules.global.ACD;

public class ACD_Subclass extends ACD {
    public void method() {
        super.method(this);
    }
}

As you can see, 'ACD.java' imports 'ACD_Subclass.java' and 'ACD_Subclass.java'
imports 'ACD.java'.  This creates a confusing dependency cycle between these two
files.

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
There is no single recommended fix for all violations of this rule because the
fix depends on the situation.  In this case, the fix is to avoid referencing the
subclass from the superclass.

File 'ACD_Fixed.java' in package 'examples.rules.global':

package examples.rules.global;

public abstract class ACD_Fixed {
    public void method(ACD_Fixed ACD_obj) {
    }
}

File 'ACD_Fixed_Subclass.java' in package 'examples.rules.global':

package examples.rules.global.other_package;

import examples.rules.global.ACD_Fixed;

public class ACD_Fixed_Subclass extends ACD_Fixed {
    public void method() {
        super.method(this);
    }
}
