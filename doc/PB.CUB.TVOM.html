Avoid type variable parameters when calling overloaded methods [PB.CUB.TVOM]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule flags instances when a type variable is passed to an overloaded
method.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.0


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule only checks projects with a compiler compliance of JDK 1.5 or later as
varargs were introduced in JDK 1.5.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore overloaded methods with dissimilar parameters (default false)
    Enabling this parameter will cause only overloaded methods with "similar"
    parameter types to be counted. This parameter can be used to reduce
    violations to the more confusing instances.

    Types are considered "similar" in the following conditions:
        1) The erasure of the types match
        2) One type is a primitive wrapper of the other
        3) Either type is a type variable
        4) Either type is assignment compatible to the other
    Varargs parameter types are checked against all subsequent parameters of the
    other method. For example:
        void method(int i, Object...args) {}
        void method(int i, String s, Double d) {}
    In this example, "String" and "Double" will be checked for similarity to
    "Object" as they are in the corresponding positions represented by the
    varargs.

-Ignore overloaded methods with dissimilar return types (default false)
    Enabling this parameter will cause only overloaded methods with "similar"
    return types to be counted. This parameter is disabled by default as a
    method's return type does not necessarily have to be used, and confusion
    may still remain as to which method is being called.

    Types are considered similar in the following conditions:
        1) The erasure of the types match
        2) One type is a primitive wrapper of the other
        3) Either type is a type variable
        4) Either type is assignment compatible to the other

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

When a type variable is passed to an overloaded method, it can confusion as to
which method is actually being called. This may also harm readability as it is
not instantly clear which method is being called. Furthermore, the type variable
may be translated into an unexpected type by the compiler. See EXAMPLE for more
information.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this example the compiler translates the "print(T)" to "print(Object)". This
leads to the "printMethod(Object)" method ultimately being called, which is
counterintuitive.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class TVOM {
    static void printMethod(Object o) {
        System.out.println("Object");
    }

    static void printMethod(String s) {
        System.out.println("String");
    }

    static &lt;T&gt; void print(T t) {
        printMethod(t); //VIOLATION
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("test");
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Refactor the code such that either the method is no longer overloaded, or a type
variable is no longer passed to an overloaded method.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class TVOMFixed {
    static void printMethod(Object o) {
        System.out.println("Object");
    }

    static void printMethod(String s) {
        System.out.println("String");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printMethod("test"); //FIXED
    }
}
