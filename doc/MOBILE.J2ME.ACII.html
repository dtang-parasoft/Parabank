DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies anonymous classes used as interface implementors. 
An error is reported for any  anonymous inner class used to implement an
interface. 

Anonymous classes have become a popular pattern for
implementing event listeners or Runnables, even though they are often
not necessary and incur the overhead of an additional class and an
additional object creation. Often, the interface can be implemented
by the enclosing class, and an existing instance of that class can
be re-used. However, this refactoring can be applied only if the
anonymous class has an object context and defines no additional
fields. Additional fields indicate that the anonymous class keeps
its own object state; in this case a refactoring cannot be easily
applied.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule typically reduces the number of classes required for an
embedded application. Re-using an existing instance of the
enclosing class reduces the number of allocated objects (and
therefore the strain on memory and the garbage collector). It
also often improves the readability of the code by eliminating the
awkwardly-nested syntax of anonymous inner classes.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Consider the following code, which incurs the overhead of an
additional class and an additional object creation to perform a very
simple task:

package examples.rules.mobile.j2me;

public class ACII extends Frame {
     private TextField text;

     public ACII() {
         add(text = new TextField(), "Center");
         pack();
         setVisible(true);
         text.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { // VIOLATION
             public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
                 text.setText("");
             }
         });
     }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The example code can be rewritten without the inner class as:

package examples.rules.mobile.j2me;

public class ACIIFixed extends Frame
 implements ActionListener { // FIXED
     private TextField text;

     /**
      * Creates a new example object.
      */
     public ACIIFixed() {
         add(text = new TextField(), "Center");
         pack();
         setVisible(true);
         text.addActionListener(this); // FIXED
     }

     public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
         text.setText("");
     }
}
