DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies unparenthesized complex expression that are passed to 'print()' or
'println()' of 'java.io.PrintStream' as arguments. An error is reported for each occurrence.

As Java allows string concatenation using the '+' operator, ambiguity could easily arise
when string concatenation are mixed with other operators (==, != etc.) in a single 
statement. These ambiguities could sometimes lead to possible bugs. In most cases, 
these bugs would be revealed at compile time as type incompatibilities. However, 
'print()' and 'println()' from 'PrintStream' basically accept all primitive types which 
makes these possible bugs hard to be distinguished until runtime. In order to avoid
ambiguity, the programmer should parenthesize the expression correspondingly.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class STRCC {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
         Object obj = null;
         System.out.println("Obj is " 
                          + obj != null ? obj.toString() : "null"); 
                  //VIOLATION, as the compiler would interpret
                  //the expression as ("Obj is" + obj) != null, which is not intended
     }
}
