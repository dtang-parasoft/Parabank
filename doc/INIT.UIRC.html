DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to
unpredictable or unintended results." [CWE-457]

This rule identifies code with read access of uninitialized fields before or
during constructor execution. An error is reported for each occurrence.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Initial variables usually contain junk, which can not be trusted for
consistency. This can lead to denial of service conditions, or modify
control flow in unexpected ways. In some cases, an attacker can
"pre-initialize" the variable using previous actions, which might enable
code execution. This can cause a race condition if a lock variable check
passes when it should not." [CWE-457]

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Maximum level of checking allowed (default is 4)
 Note that initializers and constructors could call other setter methods to
 initialize field values. However, the ones that are called might actually call
 other methods. Consequently, the total number of methods involved might be 
 extremely large. By setting the number of levels, you can determine the extent
 of the  algorithm's checking. If you set the level to a high number, fewer
 false positive errors would be reported, but the computation could increase.
 False positives are generally unlikely when the level is set at '3'.

-Check non-static fields. (default is true)
-Check static fields. (default is true)
-Ignore fields of primitive types. (default is false)
    -Fields of primitive types are implicitly initialized to either "0" or 
     "false" when they are declared.  Because of this, it may be ok to have a
     read access to a field of a primitive type.  Still, it is a good idea to 
     initialize all fields explicitly to make the code easier to read.  If you
     do not follow this convention, you may want to turn this parameter on to
     prevent false positives for fields of primitive types which are 
     intentionally read without being explicitly initialized.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Read access of uninitialized fields is generally dangerous and could 
indicate a bug-- especially when the read access is placed in or before
a constructor.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.init;

public class UIRC {
    Vector v; //uninitialized field
    UIRC(Object singleElement) {
        v.add(singleElement); //VIOLATION
    }
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.init;

public class UIRCFixed {
    Vector v;
    UIRC(Object singleElement) {
        v= new Vector();      //FIXED
        v.add(singleElement); //FIXED
    }
}
