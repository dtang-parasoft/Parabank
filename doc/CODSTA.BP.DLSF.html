DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By convention, logger objects should be declared as "static" and "final" fields.
This rule will flag a violation for fields which are declared as having a logger
type but which are non-"final" and/or non-"static".  The rule will also flag a 
violation for local variables which have a logger type.  By convention, loggers
should be fields and not local variables.

<PRE>

-Logger Types to Check:
    -Default values are:
     java.util.logging.Logger
     org.apache.log4j.Logger
     
By default, this rule will only check the types "java.util.logging.Logger" and 
"org.apache.log4j.Logger".  These are two of the most commonly used loggers.  If
you use a logger other than these two, you should add the fully qualified name 
of that logger to the parameter list.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The conventions of logger usage dictate that each class should have no more than 
one logger and that this logger should never be reassigned once it is created.  
The best way to ensure this is to declare all loggers as "static final" fields.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this example, each instance of the class 'DLSF' will have its own copy of the
logger since the logger field is not declared "static".  This goes against the
conventions of logger usage.

package examples.rules.codsta.bp;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class DLSF {
    private final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger("DLSF");  //VIOLATION - 'LOGGER' is not "static"
    
    public void testMethod() {
        LOGGER.info("In 'testMethod()'");
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR

<PRE>

Declare the logger as both "static" and "final".  If it is a local variable,
change it to a "static final" field.

package examples.rules.codsta.bp;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class DLSF_Fixed {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger("DLSF_Fixed");  //FIXED
    
    public void testMethod() {
        LOGGER.info("In 'testMethod()'");
    }
}
