DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "synchronized" blocks which synchronize on "public" 
fields. An error is reported for each occurrence.

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

Synchronizing on "public" fields can cause deadlock conditions, which can 
lead to denial of service problems. See BENEFITS for more information.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check fields with the following accessibilites:
    -Check "public" fields (default on)
    -Check non-"private" fields

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If you synchronize on a "public" field, it is easy for other classes to
synchronize on the same field.  This can lead to a deadlock if another class
acquires the lock on the field and does not release it.  Such deadlocks are
difficult to detect because the synchronizations often occur in different files.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this example, other classes can lock on "LOCK_OBJ" since "LOCK_OBJ" is 
"public".  This could lead to deadlocks.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class SOPF {
    public static final Object LOCK_OBJ = new Object();
    private static int _i;
    
    public int getAndSetI(int i) {
        synchronized (LOCK_OBJ) {  //VIOLATION
            _i = i;
            return _i;
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change the accessibility of the lock Object to "private" to prevent other 
classes from creating deadlocks by locking on the Object.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class SOPF_Fixed {
    private static final Object LOCK_OBJ = new Object();  //FIXED- Changed to "private"
    private static int _i;
    
    public int getAndSetI(int i) {
        synchronized (LOCK_OBJ) {
            _i = i;
            return _i;
        }
    }
}
