DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies incorrect implementations of the programming pattern known 
as "double-checked locking".  "Double-checked locking" is an attempt to 
optimize the lazy initialization pattern by only requiring the code to obtain a
lock if it sees that the field which is being lazily initialized has not already
been initialized.  The basic structure of code which uses this pattern is as
follows:

if (_field == null) {
    synchronized(this) {
        if (_field == null) {
            _field = new Field();
        }
    }
}

The pattern is as follows:

1.  Check if a field has already been initialized.
2.  Enter a "synchronized" block only if the field has not already been 
initialized.  This prevents having to synchronize every time the code is called.
3.  Once inside the "synchronized" block, check to see if the field still has 
not been initialized.  It is possible that another thread has already 
initialized the field since the first such check was made.
4.  If the field is still "null", initialize it.

This pattern is only guaranteed to work in J2SE 5.0 and later if the "volatile" 
keyword is used on the declaration of the lazily initialized field.  In earlier 
versions of the JDK, the pattern is not guaranteed to work at all.  An error is 
reported for each occurrence of the "double-checked locking" pattern which is 
not guaranteed to work correctly.

NOTES

<PRE>

This rule ignores double checked locking involving Collections or Maps.
The rules TRS.UACS and TRS.STR should be used to catch thread synchronization
errors involving Collections and Maps.

According to the book "Secure Programming with Static Analysis" (See the 
"REFERENCES" section), the problem with "double-checked locking" has been fixed 
as of J2SE 5.0 if the field in question has the "volatile" keyword in its 
declaration.  The "volatile" keyword will prevent the compiler from performing
optimizations which may cause the "double-checked locking" pattern to work
incorrectly.

Improper synchronization could cause concurrency issues that could result in 
unexpected application behavior.  This could have security implications. See

At first glance, the "double-checked locking" pattern seems to be a valid 
optimization.  However, there are subtle reasons why it may not work in a multi-
threaded environment.  The problem is that, with compiler optimizations and 
shared memory multiprocessors, it is possible that one thread will see a field 
which has only been partially initialized and think that the field has already 
been completely initialized.  This is due to reordering of the instructions in
the "synchronized" block.  The thread will then use the field as if it has been 
fully initialized and will likely run into problems.  For more details, see the
links provided in the "REFERENCES" section.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class DCL {
    private Vector data;
    
    public Vector getData() {
        if (data== null) {  //VIOLATION
            synchronized(this) {
                if (data== null) {
                    data= new Vector(); 
                }
            }
        }
        return data;
    }
}

In J2SE 5.0 and later, the "double-checked locking" pattern can be fixed by 
declaring the field in question to be "volatile":

package examples.rules.trs;

public class DCL_Fixed {
    private volatile Vector data;  //FIXED - Declare field as "volatile"
    
    public Vector getData() {
        if (data== null) {
            synchronized(this) {
                if (data== null) {
                    data= new Vector(); 
                }
            }
        }
        
        return data;
    }
}

In earlier versions of the JDK, it's not possible to fix the "double-checked 
locking" pattern.  To completely avoid the problem, the program might have to 
give up lazy initialization, which could cause a significant performance hit. 
A better approach is to ensure that every read/write of the same variable is 
"synchronized", but this will also cause a significant performance hit.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class DCLFixed {
    private Vector data 
    
    public synchronized Vector getData() { //FIXED
                                           //but penalty to performance
        if (data== null) {
            data= new Vector();
        }
        
        return data;
    }
}
