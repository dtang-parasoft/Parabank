SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Weak Security Controls
category: Code Quality

Declare public and protected classes to be final to avoid malicious overriding of
privileged code. If a malicious subclass is introduced, it can be used to access
and modify data, which is a security problem.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check unused classes (Default value is "false")



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1) It optimizes the code: because the compiler knows that nobody
   can extend the class or override its methods, it
   can generate optimized code.

2) It makes the code self documenting: somebody looking at the
   class will know that no other class extends this class.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Make the class "final" or document the reason for the
class not being final.
