"final".  An error is reported for each occurrence.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declaring a method as "final" in a final class is redundant.  A final class cannot 
be extended; hence, its methods cannot be overridden.  This means that it is not 
necessary to declare these methods "final".


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declaring methods "final" in "final" classes helps to emphasize that these methods
cannot be overridden.  Although it is not necessary, some people may still prefer to
declare such methods as "final" for this reason.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public final class FMFC {
    public final void myMethod() {  //VIOLATION
        //some code
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the "final" keyword from the method declaration.

package examples.rules.uc;

public final class FMFC {
    public void myMethod() {  //FIXED
        //some code
    }
}
