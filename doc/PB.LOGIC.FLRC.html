Avoid infinite recursive method calls [PB.LOGIC.FLRC]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will detect cases where infinite recursion is likely.  There are two
common cases which lead to infinite recursion:

1.  A method calls itself before executing any other code.  That is, the method
is called recursively within the first statement of its definition.  This case 
is guaranteed to lead to an infinite recursion if the code is ever executed.

2.  A method calls itself using the same arguments that were passed as 
parameters into the method without first modifying the parameters.  This 
may lead to an infinite recursion if this method call is ever executed.  This
case will not be flagged by default since it is more difficult to determine 
whether or not the code will lead to an infinite recursion in this case.

By default, the rule will only check for case #1 described above.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Erratic Application Behavior

Infinite recursion can easily cause an application to crash.  Secure 
applications should make sure that all recursions will eventually terminate.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Infinite recursion can be difficult to detect, especially if not all execution
paths are exercised during testing.  You should make sure that recursion is 
correctly implemented by checking a base case before executing a recursive call
and remembering to modify the arguments before calling a method recursively 
using the same arguments that were passed as parameters.

PARAMETER

-Only check the first statement of each method.
    -When this parameter is enabled, the rule will only check for recursive 
     calls within the first statement of a method.  Recursive calls later in the
     method may or may not result in an infinite recursion depending on the 
     control flow of the method.  However, recursive calls within the first
     statement are guaranteed to lead to an infinite recursion because they will
     always be executed.
    -By default, this parameter is "on" to reduce noise. 
-Allow recursive calls within the first statement if the call is in the "then" 
 or "else" part of a conditional expression. (Default is on.)
    -When this parameter is enabled, the rule will allow recursive calls within 
     the first statement of a method in conditional expressions of the form 
     "a ? b : c" provided that the recursive call appears in the "then" or 
     "else" portion of the conditional expression.  A violation will be flagged 
     regardless of the value of this parameter if the recursive call is made in 
     the conditional part of the conditional expression (the part represented by 
     "a"). 
-Ignore calls to potentially overridden methods where the calling object is not 
 "this". (Default is on.)
    -If the method being called is non-"static", non-"private", and non-"final" 
     and the calling object is not "this" (either explicitly or implicitly), it
     is impossible to determine before runtime which method will be called since 
     overridden versions of the method may be called.  Which method will be 
     called depends on the runtime type of the calling object.  For this reason, 
     the rule cannot determine whether or not "recursive" calls on the first 
     line where the calling object is not "this" will cause an infinite 
     recursion in these cases.  By default, such cases will not be flagged as 
     violations.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.logic;

public class FLRC {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("3! = "+factorial(3));
    }
    
    public static int factorial(int num) {
        return num * factorial(num - 1);  // VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this case, check for a base case so that the recursion will terminate 
normally.

package examples.rules.pb.logic;

public class FLRCFixed {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("3! = "+factorial(3));
    }
    
    public static int factorial(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {                    // FIXED
            return 1;
        }
        
        return num * factorial(num - 1);
    }
}
