DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies caught exceptions that are not used in the "catch" block. 
An error is reported for each occurrence.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Comment to suppress the error (in regular expression)
    -This rule will not report an error if a specific comment is included in the
     "catch" block.  By default, the rule will not report an error if an "ignore 
     exception" comment is included in the "catch" block.
-Ignore exceptions with names matching the following regular expression(s):
    -The rule will not flag a violation if the name of the exception matches one
     of the regular expressions specified in this list.  Matching is not case
     sensitive, so differences in case will be ignored.
    -By default, the list includes "^ignore$", which means that violations will 
     not be flagged for exception variables with the name "ignore".

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If the caught exception is not used inside of the "catch" block, 
it may be more difficult to determine where and why the exception occurred.
For example, it is difficult to trace back the cause of the exception 
without using a method such as printStackTrace().

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public class UCATCH {

    public void method () {
        try {
            System.in.read ();
        } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException");
        }
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Ensure the caught exception is used in the "catch" body.

package examples.rules.uc;

public class UCATCHFixed {

    public void method () {
        try {
            System.in.read ();
        } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException : " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
