DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that hides inherited "static" member methods. An
error is reported if an inherited method is overridden by a child class.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not flag cases where the "static" method is overridden solely to
improve the visibility of the method. The criteria for this are:
1) The overriding method only calls the overridden method.
2) The overriding method has less restricted visibility than the overridden
method.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Hiding  inherited "static" member methods is often considered poor style. 
Following this rule makes code less confusing and error prone.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.oop;

class SuperAHSM {
    static void method1 () {}
}

public class AHSM extends SuperAHSM {
    static void method1 () {}  // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The solution will depend on the design of the program, but
may be as simple as using the inherited method and removing
the method declared in the child class.
