DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies methods in a subclass that override methods in a
superclass. If so, the rule checks that all overloaded methods in the
superclass are also overridden in the subclass.  The rule ignores cases where
the superclass method is private or is in another package with default
accessibility.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Fixing this violation by simply calling the superclass implementation may cause
it to be flagged by the rule UC.SO. Additionally, if a superclass method is
concrete and calls an abstract method, a violation is not flagged. This is
because the usage suggests that only the abstract is intended to be overridden
in subclasses.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore the following methods:
    -"visit", "accept", "beginVisit", "endVisit",
    "run", "read", "write", "print" (default)

-Ignore methods with empty bodies (default true)

-Ignore "chained" methods (default true)
    Enabling this parameter will ignore methods which directly call an
    overloaded method. In these instances it is more likely that the intent is
    to only override one of the methods. For example:
        class OSM {
            void print(String s) {
                print();
                System.out.print(s);
            }
            void print() {}
        }
        class OSM2 extends OSM {
            void print() {
                System.out.print("String is: ");
            }
        }
    Note that if a method conditionally calls an overloaded method (e.g. for the
    above example if 'print()' were called in an if/else block) then a violation 
    will still be reported.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Inconsistent changes between a subclass and its superclass sometimes leads to
overriding a superclass method when the intent was to override another.  This
rule helps to identify those cases where a user may have missed overriding a 
method when it was intended to do so.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

class OSM {
    public void print(String s){
        System.out.println("String is: "+s);
    }
}
class OSM2 extends OSM {
    public void print(Object o) { //VIOLATION
        System.out.println(o.toString());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object o = getUserString();
        print(o);
    }
}

At runtime it isn't clear which print method might be called and the program
could yield unexpected results. For clarity override the other "print" method
as well.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

class OSMFixed {
    public void print(String s){
        System.out.println("String is: "+s);
    }
}
class OSM2Fixed extends OSMFixed {
    public void print(Object o) { //FIXED
        System.out.println(o.toString());
    }
    public void print(String s) {
        super.print(s);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object o = getUserString();
        print(o);
    }
}
