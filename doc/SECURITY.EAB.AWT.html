DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Web components should not use AWT components.  This rule will flag a violation
for each method invocation from the "java.awt" package in a web component. A
class or interface is considered a web component if it extends or implements a
type from the "javax.servlet" package.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Erratic Application Behavior

Web components which have AWT code in them are likely to have unanticipated 
functionality from an architectural point of view, which decreases the quality 
and security of the application. Additionally, it may represent an entry point 
for an attacker.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Maximum depth to look for calls to AWT methods (default "2")
    This parameter allows for indirect checking of AWT calls. Specifying a value
    of "1" will only check for direct calls to these methods. A value of "2"
    will check if any of the methods called from the web component in turn call
    an AWT method, and so on.
    Note that using a large value may significantly slow execution of the rule.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

J2SE Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) functionality should not be used in web 
components. Web components are server-side, front end transactional components, 
and containers are designed to facilitate high-throughput transaction 
processing. As such, interaction with a keyboard or a display will 
interfere with these objectives. Therefore, it is not recommended to use AWT
functionality in web components.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.security.bv;

import javax.servlet.Servlet;
import java.awt.ActionEvent;

public class AWT implements Servlet {
    public testMethod(ActionEvent ae) {
        ae.dispatch(); //VIOLATION
    }
    ...
}

Avoid using anything from the "java.awt" package.
