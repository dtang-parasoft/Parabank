DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that the declarations of all local variables have a comment
either before or after them.  A violation will be flagged for each local 
variable which is not commented.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will not flag a violation for variables declared in the initializer
of a "for" loop.  It is common practice to define index variables here with no
comment.

For lines on which there are multiple variable declarations, the rule will not 
flag a violation for either the first or the last variable declared on the line 
if there is a comment at the end of the line.  In this case, it is unclear 
whether the comment was intended to go with the first variable declaration or 
the last variable declaration, so neither is flagged.  This only applies with 
the default setting of the parameters ("After declaration").  For example, it is
unclear which variable the comment is supposed to go with in the following line:

int i, j, k;  //This comment is ambiguous.

Neither "i" nor "k" would be flagged.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Comment Positioning
    -Before declaration
        -If this option is selected, the rule will look for a comment 
         immediately preceding the variable declaration, either on the same line
         or on the previous line.
    -After declaration (default value)
        -If this option is selected, the rule will look for a comment 
         immediately following the variable declaration.  The comment must begin 
         on the same line as the variable declaration.
-Excluded Variable Types (Specify fully qualified names)
    -Variables which have a type specified in this list will not be checked.
    -Default value is an empty list.
    -The rule will check the type hierarchy of each variable type to make sure 
     no type in the type's hierarchy is in this list.  This means that a
     variable's type will be excluded from the checking even if that type is not
     in the list if one of its superclasses or superinterfaces is in the list. 
    -For example, if variables of type "java.util.Set" are not to be flagged,
     you would add "java.util.Set" to this list.
-Excluded Variable Names (Specify using a regular expression)
    -This parameter can be turned on or off using the check box. (Default is 
     "on".)
    -Variables which have a name matching the regular expression specified here
     will not be checked.
    -Default value is "^[a-zA-Z]$".  This means that variables which have a name
     consisting of one letter will not be checked by default.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
  
All local variables should be commented to indicate what their purpose is.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class CLV {
    static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        int i = 0;
        i = a + b + c;
        return i;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Provide each local variable with a comment indicating its purpose.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class CLVFixed {
    static int add(int a, int b, int c){
        int i = 0;  //keeps track of the sum of the parameters
        i = a + b + c;
        return i;
    }
}
