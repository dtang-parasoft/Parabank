DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule looks for "implements" statements which are redundant.  A redundant
"implements" statement will happen if a class is declared to implement an
interface that was already implemented by a superclass of that class.  Once a 
superclass is declared to implement an interface, all of its subclasses will
automatically implement this interface.  This rule will flag a violation for 
each redundant declaration of an implemented interface.

<PRE>

Having a redundant "implements" statement may indicate confusion.  The 
programmer may not have been aware that a superclass already implemented the 
interface.  If this is the case, the programmer should take into consideration
whether to use the inherited version of the implemented interface or to override
this implementation.  

In any case, having a redundant "implements" statement only serves to complicate
the code unnecessarily.

package examples.rules.oop;

public class RI extends B implements A {  //VIOLATION- Superclass "B" already 
                                          // implements interface "A"
}

interface A{	
}

class B implements A{
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the unnecessary "implements" statement.  Consider whether to use the 
inherited version of the implemented interface or to override this 
implementation.

package examples.rules.oop;

public class RIFixed extends B {  //FIXED
}

interface A{	
}

class B implements A{
}
