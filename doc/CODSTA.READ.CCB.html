DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Close braces should have an end-of-line comment (a comment starting with "//")
to indicate which statement they go with.  This rule will flag a violation for 
each close brace which comes at the end of a control statement (either an "if", 
"switch", "do", "for", "while", or "else" statement) and which either:

a) does not have an end-of-line comment or
b) has an end-of-line comment which does not match the regular expression 
   specified in the parameters.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For most types of control statement, this rule will look for an end-of-line 
comment after the close brace which ends the control statement.  "do-while" 
statements are a special case.  For this case, the end-of-line comment should
come after the semicolon at the end of the statement.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-End-of-Line Comments (in Regular Expressions)
    -Comment for end of "if" block (Default is "^end if")
    -Comment for end of "else" block (Default is "^end else")
    -Comment for end of "switch" block (Default is "^end switch")
    -Comment for end of "do" statement (Default is "^end do")
    -Comment for end of "for" block (Default is "^end for")
    -Comment for end of "while" block (Default is "^end while")

The regular expressions specified in the parameters are not case sensitive.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It can be unclear which control statement a close brace goes with if there are
a lot of braces.  Using some type of standard end-of-line comment to denote the
ends of control statements can make the code much easier to read.  It is 
recommended that you use your own system for labeling the ends of control 
statements.  For instance, you could label the end of the first "for" statement
"end for 1", the end of the second "for" statement "end for 2", etc.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class CCB {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
            System.err.println(args[i]);
        }                                     //VIOLATION
    }
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Put an end-of-line comment matching the regular expression in the parameters
after each close brace which ends the body of a control statement.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class CCBFixed {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
            System.err.println(args[i]);
        }  //end for 1                  //FIXED
    }
}
