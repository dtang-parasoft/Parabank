Avoid compound synchronized collection accesses which violate atomicity [TRS.CMA]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies synchronized collections which have compound actions
performed on them in a non-atomic manner. Although the compound action may be
thread-safe, if not performed atomically confusing behavior may still occur.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v8.4


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks fields which are initialized to a synchronized wrapper from
"java.util.Collections" or legacy synchronized collections. The rule identifies
methods in which compound actions are performed on the field and the operation
is not locked on the field. If a lock other than the field is used, then the
compound operation can execute concurrently with any of the standard operations.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

See BENEFITS.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check legacy synchronized "Hashtable" and "Vector" (default off)
    This parameter is disabled by default as "Hashtable" or "Vector" may be used
    with no regard to their synchronized properties. As it is not apparent
    whether these were intended to be used in a synchronized manner or not, the
    rule may flag some cases where the user does not require the compound action
    to complete atomically.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A user may unknowingly perform a complex action and assume that the operation
is performed atomically when it is not. This may lead to an inconsistent or
unexpected state.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.trs;

public class CMA {
    List _synchList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
    Map _synchMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap()); 

    void synchronized addMap(Object o, Object p) { //VIOLATION, wrong lock
        if (!_synchMap.containsKey(o)) {
            _synchMap.put(o, p);
        }
    }
    
    void addList(Object o) { //VIOLATION, no lock
        if (!_synchList.contains(o)) {
            _synchList.add(o);
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Make sure the compound action is locked on the collection field. Alternatively,
if a lock is used make sure it is the appropriate one.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class CMAFixed {
    List _synchList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
    Map _synchMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap()); 

    void addMap(Object o, Object p) { //FIXED
        synchronized(_synchMap) {
            if (!_synchMap.containsKey(o)) {
                _synchMap.put(o, p);
            }
        }
    }

    void addList(Object o) { //FIXED
        synchronized(_synchList) {
            if (!_synchList.contains(o)) {
                _synchList.add(o);
            }
        }
    }
}
