Do not define constants in interfaces [CODSTA.POD.ISACF]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies constants in an "interface". An error is reported for each
occurrence. This rule ignores empty array instances of the interface, as it is
a common practice for memory optimization to reuse the same instance.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Jtest provides another rule, CODSTA.ORG.DCI, which conflicts with this 
rule.  Some experts recommend constants in an "interface", and others
recommend avoiding them. In response, Parasoft added rules that check both 
conventions. You should decide which convention to use, then enable the
appropriate rule.

There is also another rule, CODSTA.POD.ACIAP, which is similar in intent to 
CODSTA.POD.ISACF.  CODSTA.POD.ACIAP checks for the constant interface anti-
pattern.  CODSTA.POD.ACIAP will allow for some constants to be defined in an
interface as long as there is at least one method or inner type defined in the
interface.  On the other hand, CODSTA.POD.ISACF will flag a violation for any
constant which is defined in an interface.  If you are enforcing a strict 
standard which does not allow any constants to be defined within an interface,
you should enable this rule (CODSTA.POD.ISACF).  Otherwise, you should enable
CODSTA.POD.ACIAP.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The use of constants is an implementation detail.  Implementing an interface 
which contains constants causes this implementation detail to leak into the 
class's exported API and the Javadoc for the class.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.pod;

public interface ISACF {
    int NUM = 1234;  // VIOLATION
}
         

</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Place constants in a utility class instead of an "interface".

package examples.rules.codsta.pod;
       
public class ISACFFixed {
    private ISACFFixed () {}  // prevents instantiation
    
    public static final int NUM = 1234;
}
