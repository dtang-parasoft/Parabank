DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects "private" fields which are used but which are never set to a 
meaningful value.  By default, the rule only checks fields of non-primitive 
types.  For purposes of this rule, a meaningful value is considered to be 
anything other than "null".

This rule will also check fields of types in the Java Collections Framework.  
For these types, a violation will be flagged if no element is ever added to the 
collection.  The following collection types will be checked:

- java.util.Set
- java.util.List
- java.util.Map
- java.util.HashSet
- java.util.ArrayList
- java.util.TreeSet
- java.util.Stack
- java.util.Vector
- java.util.LinkedList

For Maps, a violation will be flagged if no mappings are ever added into the 
"Map".

If the "Check fields of primitive types" parameter is enabled, the rule will 
check that primitive fields are explicitly assigned a value within an enclosing 
class.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check fields of primitive types
    -Default value is "false".  This parameter is off by default because some 
     people may intentionally use primitive fields which are initialized to the
     default values.
    -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will check "private" fields of 
     primitive types to make sure that these fields are explicitly assigned a 
     value somewhere.  You should not rely on the default implicit 
     initialization values of primitive fields.
-Ignore "final" fields
    -Default value is "true".
    -This parameter is set to "true" by default because "final" fields which are
     initialized to "null" (or some other "meaningless" value) are often used 
     intentionally.  For instance, some method may compare another value to 
     "null" using this final field instead of the "null" literal. 
-Ignore annotations that correspond to these qualified names
    -Default value is "javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;javax.ejb.EJB;
    javax.annotation.Resource;javax.persistence.EntityManager;"
    -Some annotations indicate that a field will be initialized.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Private" fields cannot be set outside of their declaring classes if there are 
no non-"private" methods provided to set these fields.  It is most likely a bug 
if such a field is used but never assigned a meaningful value within the 
declaring class.  For instance, use of any non-primitive field which is only set 
to "null" or use of any Collection to which no elements are ever added (with no 
non-"private" setter methods) is probably a bug.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.usc;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class FCBS {
    // It is not possible to add Objects to the "_list" field, so it doesn't
    // make sense to write methods that try to use it

    private List _list = new ArrayList();

    public List getElementsWithPrefix(String prefix) {
        List list = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; _list.size(); i++) {  // VIOLATION
            String element = (String) _list.get(i);
            if (element.startsWith(prefix))
                list.add(element);
        }
        return list;
    }
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Add a non-"private" method which allows the field to be set outside of the
declaring class, or assign the field some meaningful value within the declaring 
class.  

package examples.rules.pb.usc;

public class FCBSFixed {
    private List _list = new ArrayList();

    public List getElementsWithPrefix(String prefix) {
        List list = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; _list.size(); i++) {  
            String element = (String) _list.get(i);
            if (element.startsWith(prefix))
                list.add(element);
        }
        return list;
    }
    
    public void addElements(List newElements) {  // FIXED- added method to add
                                                 // values to "_list"
        _list.addAll(newElements);
    }
}
