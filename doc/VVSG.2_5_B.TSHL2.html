Do not use blocking methods while holding a lock [VVSG.2_5_B.TSHL2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases where methods that suspend thread execution for a certain time
(such as Thread.sleep()) are called with a lock held--thus unnecessarily increasing
resource contention between threads.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter can result in more violations,
but possibly also more false positives, being reported. In this mode Flow 
Analysis will not check whether the path of the violation can be reached from
the beginning of the function. In some complicated cases, restricted analysis
depth may prevent Flow Analysis from completing the violation validation
procedure. If this happens, violation can be found only with this parameter 
turned on.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Helps prevent unnecessary resource contention between threads as well as
thread starvation.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

public class Example
{
    private Object _lockVariable;

    public void sleepThenAct()
        throws InterruptedException
    {
        synchronized (_lockVariable) {
            Thread.sleep(100); // VIOLATION
            // do something
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Removing the call to sleep() inside the synchronized block repairs the code:

public class Repair
{
    private Object _lockVariable;

    public void sleepThenAct()
        throws InterruptedException
    {
        synchronized (_lockVariable) {
            // do something
        }
    }
}
