DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By default, this rule flags any methods which are declared either "private" or 
"static" and which are also declared "final".  The rule can be customized to 
check only "private" methods or only "static" methods by changing the 
parameters.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Check "private" methods
    -Default is "true".
    -If this parameter is enabled, a violation will be flagged for any method
     which is declared both "private" and "final".
-Check "static" methods
    -Default is "true".
    -If this parameter is enabled, a violation will be flagged for any method
     which is declared both "static" and "final".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declaring a "private" method final is unnecessary due to the fact that "private"
methods cannot be overridden.  Although "static" methods can technically be
overridden (according to the Java language specification), they are usually not
intended to be overridden, so there is also no need to declare them "final". 

There are two possibilities for methods which violate this rule:

1. The "final" keyword is redundant and can be removed.  Although this is not
technically true for all "static" methods, it is true in almost all practical
cases.
2. The method was supposed to be an instance method but was accidentally 
declared "static" or was supposed to have an accessibility other "private" but 
was accidentally declared "private".

This rule will catch both of these mistakes.

<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declaring a "static" or "private" method "final" helps to emphasize that the 
method cannot be overridden.  Some people may prefer to declare "static" or 
"private" methods "final" for this reason.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.oop;

public class PSDF {
    
    public static final void foo() {} //VIOLATION
    
    private final void bar() {} //VIOLATION
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The fix for each case depends on which of the two situations described in the 
BENEFITS section applies to the case.  One possible fix is to remove the "final" 
keyword if it is unnecessary.  Another fix is to make the method non-"static" or
non-"private". 

package examples.rules.oop;

public class PSDF_Fixed {
    
    public static void foo() {} //FIXED
    
    public final void bar() {} //VIOLATION
}
