DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

All interfaces should be implemented by a concrete class, and all "abstract"
classes should be extended by a concrete class.  This rule will flag a violation
for each interface and "abstract" class which is never implemented or extended.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is similar to the rules GLOBAL.UPAC, GLOBAL.UPPC, and UC.UPC; however,
it is not the same as these rules.  Interfaces and "abstract" classes can be
"used" without ever being implemented or extended.  For instance, an unused
local variable could be declared as having an interface type even though this
interface is never implemented.  This would make the rules GLOBAL.UPAC,
GLOBAL.UPPC, and UC.UPC not detect the interface as unused code.  This rule is
designed to catch cases like this where an interface or "abstract" class is used
trivially but is never meaningfully used.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore interfaces which only declare constants
    -Interfaces which declare only constants and no inner types or methods
     generally are not intended to be implemented.  They exist only to define
     constants which are shared by multiple types, so they will not be flagged
     by default.
    -Default value is "true".

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An interface which is never implemented or an "abstract" class which is never
extended generally indicates one of two mistakes:

1) The code that implements the interface or extends the "abstract" class was
   removed, but the parent interface or "abstract" class was accidentally not
   removed.  In this case, the interface or "abstract" class is no longer
   needed.

2) The interface or "abstract" class was supposed to be implemented, but it was
   not.  This is the more serious mistake of the two.  You should provide an
   implementation of the interface or provide a concrete class which extends
   the "abstract" class.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.global;

public interface NIE {  //VIOLATION
    int getFoo();
}

class NIE_a {
    public int example(NIE NIE_obj){  //There is no meaningful way to call this
                                      //method because NIE is never implemented.
        return NIE_obj.getFoo();
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Either implement the interface or remove it.

package examples.rules.global;

public interface NIEFixed {
    int getFoo();
}

class NIE_a {
    public int example(NIEFixed NIE_obj){
        return NIE_obj.getFoo();
    }
}

class ConcreteClass implements NIEFixed {  //FIXED- provided an implementation
    public int getFoo() {
        return 8;
    }
}
