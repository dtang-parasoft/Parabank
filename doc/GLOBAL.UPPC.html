DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies unused "public" and "protected" types. An error is reported
for each occurrence.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

The "Quickfix All" feature is not available for this rule because the user
should determine whether each class should be removed separately instead of
automatically removing them all.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Weak Security Controls
category: Code Quality

Unused public code might be triggered /accessed by attackers. The code may
implement features that bypass security.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Do not report an error for classes with a main method. (Default is "true")
-Classes used in XML files
    -Sometimes classes are not used directly within other Java code, but they
     are still necessary because they are referenced by some framework within an
     XML file.  For instance, Eclipse plug-in classes may be referenced within a
     "plugin.xml" file.  Servlet classes may be referenced within a "web.xml"
     file.
    -The three columns in this table are:
        -Description: This column is used to identify what type of class the
         corresponding file pattern and XPath expression are designed to find.
         This column is not read by Jtest and only serves to help the user label
         the rows of the table.  Thus, anything can be entered in this column.
        -File Pattern (Glob Expression):
         The format of this Glob expression is "&lt;project name&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;".
         Project name is optional, so if it is not provided, any file matching
         the "file name" expression, regardless of project will be matched.
         Both "project name" and "file name" are treated as individual glob
         expressions. They should be separated by a '/' character, only if
         "project name" is specified. For example: "org.eclipse.*/plugin.xml"
         would match any "plugin.xml" file in a project starting with
         "org.eclipse".
         This Glob expression is used to describe the names of the XML files
         within a project for which the corresponding XPath expression should
         be applied to try to find usages of classes.
             -Glob expressions are a simplified version of regular expressions.
              They use the convention that a "*" matches zero or more instances
              of any character and that a "?" matches one instance of any
              character.  In standard regular expressions, ".*" is used to match
              zero or more instances of any character, and "." is used to match
              one instance of any character.
             -If you are unfamiliar with how Glob expressions work, you should
              consult the Javadoc for Apache's GlobCompiler:
              <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/org/apache/oro/text/GlobCompiler.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/org/apache/oro/text/GlobCompiler.html</A>
        -XPath Expression: The XPath expression is used to identify where
         references to the corresponding class type will be found in the XML
         files.  This expression will be applied to all the XML files in a
         project matching the regular expression specified in the second column.
         The rule will look for all matches of a fully qualified type name to
         the nodes returned by this expression and will consider all such
         matches to be valid uses of the corresponding class.
    -The default values of this parameter are:

     Description       | File Pattern            | XPath Expression
                       | (Glob Expression)       |
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Eclipse plug-ins  | plugin.xml              | /plugin/extension//@class
     Servlets          | web.xml                 | /web-app/servlet/servlet-class/text()
     Listener          | web.xml                 | /web-app/listener/listener-class/text()

     These default values tell the rule to look for references to Eclipse plug-
     in classes in the "class" attributes of "plugin.xml" files and to look for
     references to servlet and listener classes in the bodies of "servlet-class" 
     and "listener-class" tags in "web.xml" files.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

These unused entities usually point to either:

1) Old code that is no longer needed.  This makes the code more difficult to
   understand.

2) A logical flaw (if the entity needs to be used, but other classes incorrectly
   avoid using it).


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the unused type or document the reason for its existence.
