NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that the test class follows the naming convention 
&lt;class name&gt;Test.

This rule defines a JUnit test class as any class which has a name ending in 
"Test" and which meets one of the following conditions:

1. The class extends "junit.framework.TestCase".
2. The class has at least one method with the "org.junit.Test" annotation.  This
only applies to JUnit 4.0 and later.

BENEFITS

If a test class is in the same directory as the class it tests, both will be
compiled during a normal build.
