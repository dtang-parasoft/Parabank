DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies interface constants that are not
referenced with its declaring interface name. An error is
reported for each occurrence.

NOTES

Java 5.0 introduced static import construct. With static 
import, it is OK to reference an interface constant without
its declaring interface name.

To avoid using prefixes when referencing interface constants,
programmers sometimes make the referencing classes implement 
the interfaces in order to have inherited access to those
constants. This practice, called the Constant Interface 
Antipattern, is not recommended. 

This is considered as bad Java programming practice because 
when a class implements an interface, it becomes part of the
class's public API. Implementation details, such as using 
the static members of another class, should not leak into 
public APIs. 

Any simple name access to interface constant from outside of
its declaring scope is an indication of such a bad 
programming practice.
