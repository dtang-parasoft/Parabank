blank lines, and "{ }" braces.

</STRONG>
<PRE>

Jtest will report an error if the value is greater or equal 500.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Big classes are difficult to understand and maintain. Consider breaking down
big classes into smaller ones performing related tasks.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

We count from the line containing the class' opening "{" brace to the line
containing the class' closing "}" brace.

The following class counts as two lines:

package examples.rules.metrics;

public class CTNL {
}

//As does this one:

class CTNL2
{
}
