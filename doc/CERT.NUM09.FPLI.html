DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
 
Using floating-point loop indices can lead to unexpected results.  This rule 
will flag a violation for each case where a floating-point variable (a variable 
of type "double" or "float") is used as the index for a loop.

-Ignore variables which are compared using "&lt;" or "&gt;" in the conditional 
 expression 
    -Default is "false"
    -It is not recommended to use floating-point variables as loop indices 
     because of potential overflow problems, but there are many cases where you 
     know that overflow will not be a problem.  In these cases, it may be OK to
     use a floating-point loop index as long as the index variable is being 
     compared in the conditional expression using "&lt;" or "&gt;" (not "&gt;=", "&lt;=", 
     "==", or "!=").  It is never recommended to test for equality using 
     floating-point quantities because these quantities are imprecise.  If you 
     are getting too many false positives for cases where overflow is not a 
     problem and no equality comparison is made, try enabling this parameter.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Using floating-point loop indices can lead to unexpected results, especially
when the value of the index is so large that it causes overflow.  For instance, 
the "float" datatype only has 24 bits of precision, which may not be enough to
accurately represent all possible values of the loop index.  This can lead to
unexpected results.  

Even if the values of the index are sufficiently small to represent using a 
"float" or "double", it is still not a good idea to use these types for loop
index variables.  This is because operations on these datatypes are imprecise.
Instead of using a floating-point variable to index a loop, a "long" or "int" 
variable should be used.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The method "foo()" below looks like it should print "Hello" 50 times.  Instead,
it prints nothing.  The reason is that the values of the index are too large to
be stored accurately in a "float" variable.

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class FPLI {
    static void foo() {
        final int START_INDEX = 1900000000;
        for (float f = START_INDEX; f &gt; START_INDEX - 50; f--) {  //VIOLATION
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use an integer datatype (such as "long") for the loop index variable. 

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class FPLIFixed {
    static void foo() {
        final int START_INDEX = 1900000000;
        for (long l = START_INDEX; l &gt; START_INDEX - 50; l--) {  //FIXED
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}
