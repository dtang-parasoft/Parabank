DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies array and collection variables that do not follow the 
user-defined naming convention (as specified in a regular expression). A 
violation will be flagged for each variable which has an array type or a type 
that implements "java.util.Collection" and which does not have a name matching
the regular expression.  The default regular expression is "(s|List|Set|Array|
Table)$", which enforces that the names end in "s", "List", "Set", "Array", or
"Table".  This regular expression is used since arrays and collections should 
have names ending in one of these suffixes to indicate that they are collections 
of objects (rather than single objects).

NOTES

<PRE>

"(s|List|Set|Array|Table)$" is used as the default regular expression since 
arrays and collections should have names ending in one of these suffixes to 
indicate that they are collections of objects (rather than single objects).

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-regular expression
    -Variable names for arrays and collections should match the listed regular 
     expression.  
    -The default is "(s|List|Set|Array|Table)$", which enforces that the name
     end in either "s" (to indicate that the variable is not a single item) or
     one of the common suffixes "List", "Set", "Array", or "Table".
-Negate regular expression
    -If this parameter is enabled, a violation will be flagged if the name of an
     array or collection variable matches the specified regular expression.
    -By default, this parameter is off.  This means that a violation will be 
     flagged for array and collection variable names which do not match the 
     regular expression specified.
-Ignore case
    -If this parameter is enabled, the regular expression will not be case
     sensitive.
    -By default, this parameter is on.  This means that differences in case will 
     be ignored when matching the names of array and collection variables to the 
     regular expression specified.
