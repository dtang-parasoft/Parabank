DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A class should contain as few references to its subclasses as possible.  While 
it is not always possible to eliminate all references to subclasses from a 
class, there is often a better way to write the code so that a class does not 
need to reference its subclasses.  This rule will flag a violation for each
reference to one of a class' subclasses from the body of the class itself.

<PRE>

Referencing the subclasses of a class from the class itself violates a basic 
principle of object-oriented design.  Whenever possible, classes should be 
independent of their subclasses.  Keeping classes independent of their 
subclasses helps to avoid confusion and allows you to take full advantage of the 
features of an object-oriented programming language.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this simple example, the class "RSFC" contains a method called 'methodA()',
and the subclasses each contain a method called 'method()'.  'methodA()' is a 
wrapper which just calls the appropriate version of 'method()' if the calling
object is an instance of either "RSFC_a" or "RSFC_b".  This code does not make 
use of method overriding, so the class "RSFC" must reference its subclasses 
several times. 

package examples.rules.oop;

public class RSFC {
    public void methodA() {
        if (this instanceof RSFC_a) {  //VIOLATION
            ((RSFC_a)this).method();  //VIOLATION
        } else if (this instanceof RSFC_b) {  //VIOLATION
            ((RSFC_b)this).method();  //VIOLATION
        } else {
            System.out.println("In methodA() for class RSFC");
        }
    }
}

class RSFC_a extends RSFC {
    public void method() {
        System.out.println("In method() for class RSFC_a");
    }
}

class RSFC_b extends RSFC {
    public void method() {
        System.out.println("In method() for class RSFC_b");
    }
}

The code shown above can be rewritten to take advantage of method overriding
and eliminate the references to the subclasses from the class "RSFC".  Once the
name of 'methodA()' is changed to 'method()', the references to the subclasses
from class "RSFC" become unnecessary. 

package examples.rules.oop;

public class RSFC_Fixed {
    public void method() {  //FIXED- changed name of method to take advantage of
                            //overriding so that subclasses do not need to be
                            //explicitly referenced from this class
        System.out.println("In method() for class RSFC_Fixed");
    }
}

class RSFC_a extends RSFC_Fixed {
    public void method() {
        System.out.println("In method() for class RSFC_a");
    }
}

class RSFC_b extends RSFC_Fixed {
    public void method() {
        System.out.println("In method() for class RSFC_b");
    }  
}
