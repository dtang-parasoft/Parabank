DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies cases where an integer addition, which may overflow, is
divided by a power of 2. An error is reported for each occurrence.

In some situations it is common to perform an addition, which is then divided by
a power of 2. In the case of array allocation or access, the user may wish to
subdivide the array and perform various operations. However, if an addition
overflowed then the array might be allocated or accessed with a negative value
which would cause an exception to be thrown. Replacing the division with an
unsigned right shift prevents the result of the operation from being negative.
However, this may cause unexpected behavior. See DRAWBACKS for more information.

DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By replacing the division with an unsigned right shift, the behavior of the
program may be altered. In the case of array allocation an array of unexpected
or insufficient size may be created if the integer addition overflowed. In many
cases it may be beneficial to perform the integer addition beforehand and handle
cases of overflow, or to attempt the array allocation in a try/catch block. This
way, the program can be structured to have a known behavior in the case of
overflow.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class IOF {

    private int[] VERY_BIG_ARRAY = new int[(Integer.MAX_VALUE + 100) / 2];  // VIOLATION
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Replace the division with an unsigned right shift or check for overflow
beforehand.

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class IOFFixed {

    private int[] VERY_BIG_ARRAY = new int[(Integer.MAX_VALUE + 100)&gt;&gt;&gt;1];  // FIXED
}
