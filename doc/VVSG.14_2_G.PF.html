occurrence.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store. . .
This weakness could be an indication of a bug in the program or a deprecated
variable that was not removed and is an indication of poor quality. This could
lead to further bugs and the introduction of weaknesses." [CWE-563]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore "final" fields (default is true)
 The "final" modifier could imply that the declared field is a constant
 for later use. Such a constant should be ignored.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Each private field makes instances of the class larger.  Mobile platforms have 
reduced resources, so optimizations are especially important.

An unused field could indicate a logical flaw in the corresponding
class, or it could be leftover from a previously-deleted section of code.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public class PF {
    private int _unusedField;  // VIOLATION
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Either correct the logic to use the field or remove the field.

package examples.rules.uc;

public class PFFixed {
      // FIXED
}
