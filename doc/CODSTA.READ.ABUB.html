DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

As of JDK 1.5, primitive types (such as "int") are assignment compatible with 
certain non-primitive wrapper types (such as "java.lang.Integer").  The compiler 
will perform automatic "boxing" and "unboxing" of primitive types with their 
equivalent wrapper types.  However, developers should not rely on this behavior
because it makes the code more difficult to read.  Automatic "boxing" and 
"unboxing" does not add any new features to the Java language since the compiler
will generate the code to perform the conversions from primitive to wrapper 
types anyway.  Automatic "boxing" and "unboxing" is just "syntactic sugar" which
makes the compiler implicitly perform conversions that programmers previously 
had to do explicitly.    This rule enforces that a primitive type is not used in 
places where a non-primitive type is expected and vice versa.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Automatic "boxing" and "unboxing" is likely to confuse readers who are not used 
to primitive and wrapper types being used interchangeably.  Explicitly performing 
conversions between primitive types and wrapper classes is usually more clear 
than forcing the compiler to do the conversions implicitly.

DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Although explicitly performing all conversions between primitive and wrapper 
classes can lead to clearer code, doing so will also make the code more verbose. 
The ability to use primitive types and their associated wrapper classes 
interchangeably is a convenience feature which will make the code more compact
because it eliminates the need for explicit conversions.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

import java.util.List;

public class ABUB {
    public void add (List listObj)    
    {
        listObj.add(5);  // VIOLATION
        Integer i = (Integer) listObj.get(listObj.size() - 1);
        method(i);  // VIOLATION
    }
    
    public void method (int i)
    {
        System.err.println("The number is " + i);
    }
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

Perform all boxing and unboxing explicitly.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

import java.util.List;

public class ABUBFixed {
    public void add (List listObj)    
    {
        listObj.add(Integer.valueOf(5));  // FIXED
        Integer i = (Integer) listObj.get(listObj.size() - 1);
        method(i.intValue());  // FIXED
    }
    
    public void method (int i)
    {
        System.err.println("The number is " + i);
    }
}
