DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies single character literals that are not placed in constants.
This means that single character literals can only be used when they are declared
"static" and "final". An error is reported for each occurrence, with the
following exception: an error is not reported if a special comment was added
to the line of code that does not follow the rule.

You can use the following special comment to prevent Jtest from reporting
any INTER rules for a specific line of code:

1. /* NOI18N */

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.inter;

public class NCL {
    public void method () {
        System.out.println ('c');  // VIOLATION
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Put the literal into a constant.

package examples.rules.inter;

public class NCLFixed {
    public void method () {
        System.out.println (mychar);  // FIXED
    }
    private static final char mychar = 'c';
}
