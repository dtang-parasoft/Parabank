DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies the use of "abstract" classes that only contain method signatures and
"static" "final" fields. An error is reported for each occurrence.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-ignore classes with non-public members
    Classes with any private or protected members will not be flagged.
    Classes with default accessibility will still be flagged as the 
    accessibility may have been mistakingly forgotten.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

These classes should be declared as "interface"s. The only difference
between these classes and "interface"s is that other classes can 
"extend" a single class, but they can "implement" multiple interfaces.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The use of "abstract" classes in place of interfaces could be part of a
policy to avoid multiple inheritance.  However, in most cases, programming to an
interface is recommended.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.oop;

public abstract class ASFI {  // VIOLATION
    abstract void method();
    final static String ID = "final static string";
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Replace "abstract class" with "interface".

package examples.rules.oop;

public interface ASFIFixed {  // FIXED
    void method();
    String ID = "MISC_ASFI";  // No need for "final static", it is implied
}
