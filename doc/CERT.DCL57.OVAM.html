DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule flags varargs methods which have been overloaded.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.0


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule only checks projects with a compiler compliance of JDK 1.5 or later as
varargs were introduced in JDK 1.5.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore overloaded methods with dissimilar parameters (default true)
    Enabling this parameter will cause only overloaded methods with "similar"
    parameter types to be counted. This parameter can be used to reduce
    violations to the more confusing instances.

    Types are considered similar in the following conditions:
        1) The erasure of the types match
        2) One type is a primitive wrapper of the other
        3) Either type is a type variable
        4) Either type is assignment compatible to the other
    Varargs parameter types are checked against all subsequent parameters of the
    other method. For example:
        void method(int i, Object...args) {}
        void method(int i, String s, Double d) {}
    In this example, "String" and "Double" will be checked for similarity to
    "Object" as they are in the corresponding positions represented by the
    varargs.

-Ignore overloaded methods with dissimilar return types (default false)
    Enabling this parameter will cause only overloaded methods with "similar"
    return types to be counted. This parameter is disabled by default as a
    method's return type does not necessarily have to be used, and confusion
    may still remain as to which method is being called.

    Types are considered similar in the following conditions:
        1) The erasure of the types match
        2) One type is a primitive wrapper of the other
        3) Either type is a type variable
        4) Either type is assignment compatible to the other

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Overloading varargs methods can cause confusion as to which method is called and
harm readability.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class OVAM {
    void method(int i, Object... args) { //VIOLATION
        ...
    }

    void method(int i, String s) {
        ...
    }
}

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class OVAMFixed {
    void method(int i, Object... args) {
        ...
    }

    void method2(int i, String s) { //FIXED
