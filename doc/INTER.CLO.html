DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that uses single characters with logic operators.
An error is reported for each occurrence, with the following exceptions:

1.  An error is not reported if a special comment was added to the line of code 
that does not follow the rule.

2.  An error is not reported for cases where a character value is compared 
against only a single character literal.  This rule was designed to catch cases
where a character value is compared against several values or a range of values
in an expression involving the "||" or "&amp;&amp;" conditional operators.

NOTES

<PRE>

You can use the following special comment to prevent Jtest from reporting
any INTER rules for a specific line of code:

1. /* NOI18N */


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore characters passed to the following methods
    -Default values:
        ^java.io.PrintStream#^print.*$
        ^java.lang.System$^.*$

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In an internationalized environment, comparing single characters with character
literals using the "&gt;", "&gt;=", "&lt;", "&lt;=", "==", or "!=" operators often will not
work.  If necessary, the comparison should be replaced with a call to one of the
"static" methods in the "Character" class, such as 'isLetter()', 'isDigit()', or
'isSpaceChar()', or a customized utility method designed to handle international
characters.  


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule may flag some violations for cases that do not need to be fixed.  For 
these cases, you should suppress the violation or add a comment as described in
the "NOTES" section.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.inter;

public class CLO {
    public boolean isLetter (char ch) {
        boolean _isLetter = ( ch &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'z')  // VIOLATION
            || (ch &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'Z');
        return _isLetter;
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use the character comparison methods, which use the Unicode standard to 
identify character properties. Thus, replace the above "if" statement as follows:

package examples.rules.inter;

public class CLOFixed {
    public boolean isLetter (char ch) {
        boolean _isLetter = Character.isLetter(ch);  // FIXED
        return _isLetter;
    }
}
