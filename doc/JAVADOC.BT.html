DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies unsupported '@' tags in Javadoc comments. An error is
reported for each '@' tag that does not match one of the regular expressions
specified in the parameter table.  It also can check for any tags which are
supported but which, for some reason, the user does not want to use.  For
instance, according to the Eclipse Javadoc conventions, '@version' tags should
be avoided.

PARAMETERS

-Allowed Javadoc tag list (in regular expressions)
  By default, the following Javadoc tags are allowed:
      @author
      @version
      @see
      @param
      @return
      @exception
      @throws
      @deprecated
      @since
      @serial
      @serialData
      @serialField
      @linkplain
      @inheritdoc
      @category
      @cat
      @list
      @example
      @tutorial
      @index
      @exclude
      @hide
      @docRoot
      @obsolete
      @todo
      @internal
      @beaninfo
      @pre
      @preconditions
      @post
      @postconditions
      @concurrency
      @assert
      @verbose
      @invariant
      @date
      @link
 To disallow the use of one of the above supported tags, you need to remove it
 from this list.  You can also add another supported tag to the list.
    -This list accepts regular expressions.  For instance, to specify that all tags
     beginning with "@ejb" are to be allowed, you would add the regular
     expression "^@ejb.*" to the list.
    -If a regular expression is entered which does not begin with "^" or end
     with "$", the rule will assume that these characters should have been
     included and add them for you.  This saves the need to deal with awkward
     regular expression syntax if you just want to specify the tag names.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A Javadoc comment may use special tags, which all begin with the '@' character,
to allow Javadoc to provide additional formatting for the documentation.  Also,
there are some instances where the user wants to disallow the use of a certain
tag even though this tag is supported (such as the "@version" tag when
following the Eclipse conventions).

package examples.rules.javadoc;

/**
 * Javadoc comment
 * @unsupported tag
 */
public class BT {
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Either change the tag to one of the allowed tags or remove it.  Also, if the
Javadoc comments contain HTML markup tags, you should check for errors in the
HTML tags.

package examples.rules.javadoc;

/**
 * Javadoc comment
 * replaced tag with comment text.  // FIXED
 */
public class BTFixed {
}
