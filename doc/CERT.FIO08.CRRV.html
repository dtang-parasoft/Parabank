DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Methods which read or skip input usually return either the number of bytes read
or skipped or the byte that was read (for methods which only read one byte).
Either way, the return value of these methods should be checked instead of just
being ignored.  For methods that return the number of bytes read or skipped, you
should check that the number of bytes actually read or skipped matches the
desired number of bytes.  For methods which return the byte read (such as "java.
io.InputStream.read(byte[])"), you should check that the end of the stream has
not been reached.

This rule will flag a violation for each case where the return value of one of
the methods specified in the parameter list is discarded without being used in
an expression or assigned to a variable.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Currently there is only a Quick Fix for a few specific cases of this rule.  The
cases which have a Quick Fix are calls to the "read(byte[])" or "read(byte[],
int, int)" methods of types which implement the "java.io.DataInput" interface.
In these cases, a good fix is usually to use the "readFully(byte[])" or
"readFully(byte[], int, int)" method instead of the "read()" methods.  Thus,
there is a Quick Fix to change the call to the "read()" method to a call to the
"readFully()" method in these cases.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The software does not check the return value from a method or function, which
can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions. . . If
an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is
not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability,
because the software is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For
example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check
the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then
the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges." [CWE-252]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Methods to be checked:
 (in form of &lt;fully qualified type name&gt;#&lt;method&gt;(&lt;parameter1 type&gt;,&lt;parameter2 type&gt;))
    -Default values are:
        -java.io.InputStream#read()
        -java.io.InputStream#read(byte[])
        -java.io.InputStream#read(byte[],int,int)
        -java.io.InputStream#skip(long)
        -java.io.DataInput#skipBytes(int)
    -The rule will also check calls to methods which override or implement a
     method specified in this list.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Forgetting to check the return value of methods which read or skip input is a
common cause of bugs.  It is possible that the end of the stream was reached or
that fewer bytes were read or skipped than the caller requested for some other
reason.  You must check the return value to properly handle this case.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.pb.logic;

import java.io.*;

public class CRRV{
    public byte[] readFully(InputStream input, int length) throws IOException
    {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[length];
        input.read(buffer, 0, length); // VIOLATION
        return buffer;
    }

    public byte[] readFully(DataInputStream input, int length) throws IOException
    {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[length];
        input.read(buffer, 0, length);  // VIOLATION
        return buffer;
    }
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

Check the return value of the 'read()' method.  In particular, you should always
check that the return value is not negative to make sure the end of the stream
was not reached.

If the type being used is an input stream which implements the "java.io.
DataInput" interface, you can use one of the "readFully()" methods defined in
this interface to read in the whole input stream.  These methods do not require
any return values to be checked because they will throw an exception if the
desired number of bytes could not be read.

package examples.rules.pb.logic;

import java.io.*;

public class CRRVFixed{
    public byte[] readFully(InputStream input, int length) throws IOException {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[length];
        int num_read = 0;
        while (num_read &lt; length)
        {
            int count = input.read(buffer, num_read, length - num_read);
            if (count &lt; 0)                                                // FIXED
                throw new IOException("end of stream reached");
            num_read += count;
        }
        return buffer;
    }

    public byte[] readFully(DataInputStream input, int length) throws IOException {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[length];
        input.readFully(buffer);  //FIXED
        return buffer;
    }
}
