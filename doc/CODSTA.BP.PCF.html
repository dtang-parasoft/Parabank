DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies classes that have only "private" constructors, 
but are not declared as "final". An error is reported if a class 
supplies only "private" constructors, but is not declared as a "final" class.

<PRE>

This rule would not report an error if any inner class extends
the outer class.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

If a class supplies only "private" constructors but is not 
declared as "final," then some class could try to extend it. 
However, such an inherited class could never implement its
constructors correctly because it has no access to any of the 
constructors of its parent class, which only has "private"
constructors. (It is still possible to extend such a class
by making an inner class that extends the outer class;
however, such a relationship is odd and should be avoided.)
Consequently, it makes more sense to declare that class as final 
in order to prevent any attempts to extend it.
