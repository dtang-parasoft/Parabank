DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give
valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information".
[CWE-532] 

This rule detects when sensitive data is written to log files.
The rule must be parameterized to define sensitive data and specify logging
methods; see PARAMETERS.

<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"While logging all information may be helpful during development stages, it is
important that logging levels be set appropriately before a product ships so 
that sensitive user data and system information are not accidentally exposed 
to potential attackers". [CWE-532]

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The 'Secure data processing methods' parameter allows you to specify
methods that can convert sensitive data to safe values.
Fill in the following columns to configure a method.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the securing method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the data processed by the method to be secure.
- 'Fully qualified type name (wildcard)' - specifies
    the fully qualified name of the type that declares the method. You can
    use "*" for a method declared in any type.
- 'Method name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the method.
- '+ definitions in subclasses' - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to method with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance methods.
- 'Returns secured data' - if enabled, the method secures its return value.
- 'Secured parameters' - specifies which method parameters are secured by
    the method. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all method parameters are secured.
By default, the following method is considered to secure the data it processes:
 - '[Ss]ecure*'

The 'Logging methods' parameter allows you to specify methods that write
information to log files. The rule triggers when sensitive data is passed as
a parameter to one of the listed methods.

Fill in the following columns to configure additional logging methods.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the logging method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the methods to be a logging method.
- 'Fully qualified type name (wildcard)' - specifies
    the fully qualified name of the type that declares the method. You can
    use "*" for a method declared in any type.
- 'Method name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to method with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance methods.
- 'Logged parameters' - specifies which method parameters should be checked
    for being sensitive. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma
    or use "*" to specify that all method parameters should be checked.
By default, the rule checks the parameters of the following methods:
- the "*Log*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*log*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*[Ii]nfo*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*[Ww]arn*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*[Ee]rror*" method of "*[Ll]og*" type

The 'Sensitive variables' parameter allows you to specify the names of
variables that the rule considers to be sensitive.
Fill in the following columns to configure a sensitive variable:
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the sensitive variable. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the variable to be sensitive.
- 'Fully qualified variable name (wildcard)' - specifies the fully qualified
name of the variable. You can use "*" to specify that all variables are
considered to be sensitive.
By default, the following variable names are considered to be sensitive:
- '*[Pp]assword*'
- '*[Pp]asswd*'
 
The 'Sensitive methods' parameter allows you to specify methods the rule
considers to be sensitive.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the sensitive method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a sensitive method.
- 'Fully qualified type name (wildcard)' - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method
    declared in any type.
- 'Method name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the method.
- '+ definitions in subclasses' - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are
	defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance methods.
- ''this' object is sensitive' - if enabled, the method makes the object it is
    called on sensitive.
- 'Returns sensitive data' - if enabled, the method makes its return value
    sensitive.
- 'Sensitive parameters' - specifies which method parameters are made
    sensitive by the method. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by
    a comma or use "*" to specify that all method parameters are affected.
By default, the following method is considered to be sensitive:
- '*[Pp]assword*'

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent the exposure of sensitive data to potential
attackers.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, sensitive data is passed to the 'info' method,
which writes data to a file.

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public abstract class Example
{
    private Logger logger;

    public abstract String getPassword();

    public void test01()
        throws IOException
    {
        String password = getPassword();
        logger.info(password); //  VIOLATION
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by securing the password with the secure data processing
method 'secure' before writing the data to a file.

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public abstract class Repair
{
    private Logger logger;

    public abstract String getPassword();

    public abstract String secure(String sTxt);

    public void test01()
        throws IOException
    {
        String password = getPassword();
        logger.info(secure(password)); // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
