DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that directly passes mutable fields to 
ObjectOutputStream in the 'writeObject()' method. An error is reported if these 
fields are passed to 'ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(Object)' in a custom 
serialization method (writeObject). Certain types of fields should be cloned 
before being passed to the serialization output stream.

category: Data Security

The class ObjectOutputStream may be subclassed by a malicious class that tries 
to modify object-internal data. When a direct reference to a mutable field is 
passed to the ObjectOutputStream, this reference can be used to access and 
modify the field's content. Passing a copy of the field to the 'writeObject(Object)'
method makes this kind of attack impossible.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Flags 'writeObject(obj)' invocation when 'obj' is:
    -Field which declared type is mutable. (default option)
        Any field with a declared type that is a mutable class makes code vulnerable to the attacks 
        described above. Fixing the code is necessary to ensure the security of the data.
    -Field which declared type is mutable or declared type is an interface.
        A field with a declared type that is interface could be tricky because the immutability of the
        runtime type is irrelevant to the declared type (interface). In other words, the fields could
        either be immutable or mutable solely based on the runtime execution. Inspection is suggested
        under such situation.
    -Any field.
        Even a field with a declared type that is immutable could have runtime a type as a 
        mutable subclass. To ensure a completely secured serialization, it's necessary to
        make copies of fields before invoking 'writeObject(Object)'.
