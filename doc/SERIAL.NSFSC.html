Ensure Serializable classes are correct [SERIAL.NSFSC]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies incorrect Serializable classes. Classes are 
considered to be serializable if they explicitly or implicitly implement
'java.io.Serializable'. However, serialization might still fail if classes
are not 'completely serializable'. To be 'completely serializable',
a class must satisfy all of the following requirements:

1. It must explicitly or implicitly implement java.io.Serializable. That is, 
   either the class itself must implement Serializable or a sub-interface
   of Serializable or the class's superclasses must implement Serializable.
2. All the local fields must be of COMPLETELY SERIALIZABLE types 
   or the fields must be primitive, static or transient.
3. All the superclasses must be COMPLETELY SERIALIZABLE or none of
   their fields can be non-static non-transient. 

An error is reported if all of those requirements are not satisfied.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check only classes that are explicitly stated as serializable (default is true)

This parameter controls whether classes that implicitly implement
Serializable are checked. If the checking covers any class that implements
Serializable (either implicitly or explicitly), a large number of classes 
might be reported as rule violations. 

-Check non-serializable superclasses as well (default is true)

This parameter controls whether non-serializable superclasses are checked.
A serializable class that has a non-serializable superclass would
not have its inherited fields serialized correctly. However, you might
want to skip this check because you might already expect that no field from 
non-serializable superclasses would be serialized.

-Check superclasses even if they are expected to have no field to be 
 serialized under current implementation (default is false)
 
This parameter controls whether superclasses that do not implement
java.io.Serialzable and have no field to be serialized (no existing fields or
fields that are all transient or static) are checked. If the implementations
of those superclasses remain unchanged, it would not cause serialization 
problems. However, they might still pose potential risks because more fields
might be added to those classes later on, and those fields might cause
serialization failures.
 
-Ignore classes whose source code could not be found (default is true)

This parameter controls whether classes whose source code cannot be found are
checked. Some classes might cause serialization problems, but if their source
code is not available, it is almost impossible to fix the problem.
Notice that some classes in Java standard class libraries 
might seem to cause errors during serialization by just inspecting
the enclosing fields. However, most of those classes would ensure
the correctness of serialization through other mechanisms. Consequently, rule
violations should not be reported for those classes.

-Check for Maps and Collections which may contain elements which are not 
 serializable (default is false)
 
Even if a 'Map' or 'Collection' object which is a field of a 'Serializable' class 
itself implements 'Serializable', this field may still not be completely 
serializable.  This is because all of the objects which are stored within that 
'Map' or 'Collection' must also implement the 'Serializable' interface in order for 
the serialization to work correctly.  When this parameter is enabled, the rule
will check for situations matching the following descriptions:

    1. A class implementing 'Serializable' has a field which implements the 
       'java.util.Collection' or 'java.util.Map' interface from the Java 
       Collections API and the 'java.io.Serializable' interface.
    2. An element is added to the 'Collection' or 'Map' described in the 
       previous requirement which has a type which does not implement 'Serializable'.
    3. The rule will only scan the file containing the field declaration for 
       elements which do not implement 'Serializable'.  It will not catch cases 
       where an element is added to this field from a method in a class in a 
       different file.

-Extra list of classes to be skipped

This parameter allows you to define a list of classes that you want skipped
(for whatever reason) during the checking.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Serialization is a complicated process that might involve hundreds of classes.
If all of those classes are not checked completely and carefully, 
it's very likely that the serialization will fail (that is, some of the fields will
not be serialized correctly). These serialization problems are subtle enough
that they could be overlooked during compilation or even runtime. 
This rule can be used to ensure that every single field will be 
serialized appropriately (as intended). Note that one rule violation reported
for a class does not necessarily mean that the class will have  
serialization problems; however, it does mean that the class is, at least,
potentially vulnerable to serialization problems.
