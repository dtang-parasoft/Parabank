DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule flags a violation for each place where a "getter" or "setter" method 
is used to access or set a field in the class in which that field is declared.  
Fields can always be accessed directly in their declaring class, so it is not
necessary to use "getter" or "setter" methods in this case.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will not flag a violation for any call to a "getter" or "setter" 
method which performs some actions in addition to getting or setting the field.
For purposes of this rule, a "getter" is defined as a method with one statement
that returns a field, and a "setter" is defined as a method with one statement 
which sets a field.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Indirect access of fields through "getter" and "setter" methods is unnecessary
in the class in which these fields are declared.  Accessing them in this way 
just serves to clutter the code and is less efficient.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class AFD {
    private int _i;
    
    public void method(){
        System.out.println("i: "+getI());  //VIOLATION
        setI(4);  //VIOLATION
    }
    
    public void setI(int i){
        _i= i;
    }
    
    public int getI(){
        return _i;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Access the field directly instead of using the "getter" or "setter" method.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class AFDFixed {
    private int _i;
    
    public void method(){
        System.out.println("i: "+_i);  //FIXED
        _i= 4;  //FIXED
    }
    
    public void setI(int i){
        _i= i;
    }
    
    public int getI(){
        return _i;
    }
}
