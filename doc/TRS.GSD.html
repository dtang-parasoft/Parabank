DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies calls to "getState" which are not used for debugging
purposes.

SINCE

v8.4

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule attempts to infer whether the "getState" call was used for debugging
purposes or not. The rule checks the surrounding block for calls to "print" or
to a "Logger" method and flags no violation in cases where one is present.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Concurrency

A blocked thread may not actually be in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state as
the JVM may implement blocking by spin-waiting. A thread in some cases may also
transition to RUNNABLE even if a condition it is waiting on is yet to be true.
As the accuracy of "getState" is not always reliable, it should not be used for
concurrency control purposes.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.trs;

public class GSD {
    void checkState() {
        //VIOLATION
        if (Thread.currentThread().getState() == Thread.State.WAITING) {
            ...
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If intending to use getState for debugging purposes, check that information is
reported. If intended for concurrency control, consider using another method.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class GSDFixed {
    void checkState() {
        //FIXED
        if (Thread.currentThread().getState() == Thread.State.WAITING) {
            Logger.global.warning("Waiting");
            ...
        }
    }
}
