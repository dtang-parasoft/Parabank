DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies calls to 'notify ()'. An error is reported for
each occurrence.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v4.5


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Quickfix All" feature is not available for this rule because
quickfixing violations of this rule changes the semantics of the
code.  The user should go through each violation to make sure the
quickfix does the appropriate thing.

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

Using NotifyAll() is usually safer, but can be expensive. Make the best
decision based on the application. See BENEFITS for more information.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Multiple threads may be waiting on the same object.  Using 'notify()' picks one
of the waiting threads and wakes it up.  There is no way to predict which thread
will be awakened.  A poor scheduling algorithm could leave some waiting threads
stalled much longer than others.  Therefore, use 'notifyAll()' to wake up all
waiting threads. It is also possible to have threads waiting on the same queue
waiting on different conditions. So, if only a single thread is notified, it may
simply wait again when another thread in the queue could have progressed.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Some resource allocation algorithms depend on single notification.  If all the
threads are waiting to lock a single resource, then notify only one
of the threads (if you do not care about scheduling). There may also be more
context switches incurred from waking threads which may then wait again after
the lock has been acquired.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>

package examples.rules.trs;

public class ANF {
    public synchronized void notifyThread() {
        notify ();  // VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Replace 'notify()' with 'notifyAll()'.

package examples.rules.trs;

public class ANFFixed {
    public synchronized void notifyThread() {
        notifyAll ();  // FIXED
    }
}
