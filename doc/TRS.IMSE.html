DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that tries to catch
any 'IllegalMonitorStateException'. An error is
reported for each occurrence.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

This indicates a potential concurrency design flaw. Issues
with concurrency can cause unexpected application behavior,
which may introduce security problems.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

'IllegalMonitorStateException' is thrown when a thread has 
attempted to wait on an object's monitor or to notify other threads waiting on
an object's monitor without owning the specified monitor. 
Consequently, it could indicate a program design flaw
and it's advisable to fix it instead of catching it.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.trs;

public class IMSE {
    public void myMethod() {
        try {
            //...
        } catch (IllegalMonitorStateException e) { //VIOLATION
            //...
        }
    }
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.trs;

public class IMSEFixed {
    public void myMethod() {
        //...
        //FIXED, ensure that IllegalMonitorStateException
        //cannot be thrown, no violation of synchronization
        //invariants.
    }
