DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies "static" "final" fields that are mutable. An error is 
reported for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are many reasons why a field may be "static" "final" and still be 
considered mutable.  Some of these reasons are:

1.  The field is of an array type.  The individual elements of arrays can be 
modified even if the array itself is declared as "final".  For instance, 
"SOME_ARRAY[0]= null;" is legal even if "SOME_ARRAY is a "static" "final" array.

2.  The field is of a type from the Java libraries which is known to have some 
method that makes it mutable.  Examples of such types are "java.lang.StringBuffer", 
"java.util.Collection", "java.awt.Point", "java.awt.Dimension", "java.awt.Rectangle",
and "java.util.Date".

3.  The field is of a type which has a "public" setter method (a "public" method 
which has a name beginning with "set").

4.  The field is of a type which has a "public" method which either returns a 
mutable field (based on the tests listed here for mutability) or writes to a 
field.

5.  The field is of a type which has a field that is either "public" and non-
"final" or of a mutable type (based on the tests listed here for mutability).

If you are not sure why this rule is flagging a certain "static" "final" field as 
mutable, consider whether any of the above conditions apply to the type of the 
field in question.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A public or protected static final field references a mutable object, which
allows the object to be changed by malicious code, or accidentally from another
package." [CWE-607]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

- Report mutable non-final "static" fields that are not declared "private" (disabled by default)
With this parameter enabled, the rule reports rule violation when it detects a mutable non-final
"static" field that is not declared as "private".

- Ignore types (disabled by default)
This parameter allows you to specify the types that will be ignored. Rule violations
will not be reported for the listed types.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"static" "final" fields are meant to be constants in most situations. However,
if such fields are mutable, then programmers have to be aware that the states of
those fields could still be changed despite the "static" "final" modifiers.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

import java.util.*;

public class IMM {
    public static final Set CONSTANT_SET= new HashSet(); //VIOLATION
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The programmer has to carefully assess the usage of such a constant. Use an
immutable type for the constant object if possible. Otherwise, reduce the 
accessibility of the constant object to "private", then create an accessor 
method that returns a deep copy of the object.
