DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Non-"final" "static" fields are dangerous because they are susceptible to 
concurrency problems.  When a "static" field is set and then later read, the 
only way to guarantee that the code is thread-safe is to enclose all such write
and read accesses inside a "synchronized" method or "synchronized" block (We
recommend using a "synchronized" block.  See the rule TRS.NSM for more 
discussion on this.).  All such "synchronized" blocks should synchronize on the
same object to ensure that all threads see a consistent state of the "static"
field.  

This rule will flag a violation for all cases where a non-"final" "static" field
is set and read within a method without any synchronization being 
performed.  Although such code is safe when it is run within a single thread, it
is likely to cause concurrency problems when run in a multi-threaded 
environment. See the example shown below for more details.

Improper synchronization could cause concurrency issues that could result in 
unexpected application behavior, which could have security implications.

Following this rule will help to make sure that code behaves as expected when
running in a multi-threaded environment.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The simple code shown below looks like it should always print out "_i = 3".  
However, this is not necessarily the case if this code is run in a multi-
threaded environment.  The method 'setAndPrint()' does not contain any 
synchronization, so there could be a context switch after "_i" is assigned the
value of the parameter but before "_i" is printed out.  When this happens,
another thread will take over.  This other thread could also modify "_i" and
cause the value of "_i" to be different for both the other thread and the 
original thread.  

package examples.rules.trs;

public class IASF {
    private static int _i;
    
    public static void setAndPrint(int i) {
        _i = i;  //VIOLATION - no synchronization
        System.out.println("_i = " + _i);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        setAndPrint(3);
    }
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Ideally, you should not use non-"final" "static" fields at all if an application
is designed to run in a multi-threaded context.  Using an instance field instead
of a "static" field would remove the need for synchronization.  However, if you
must use a "static" field, you should ensure that there is a "synchronized" 
block enclosing all code which modifies and then accesses the field.  The code
shown below is guaranteed to print out "_i = 3".

package examples.rules.trs;

public class IASF_Fixed {
    private static int _i;
    private static final Object LOCK_OBJ = new Object();
    
    public static void setAndPrint(int i) {
        synchronized (LOCK_OBJ) {  //VIOLATION - perform synchronization
            _i = i;
            System.out.println(_i);
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        setAndPrint(3);
    }
}
