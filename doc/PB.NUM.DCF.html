DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies floating point numbers that are compared for equality using 
"==" or "!=".  An error is reported for each occurrence. See BENEFITS for more
information.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not check cases where a comparison is made to Double.NaN or
Float.NaN. These cases are covered by the rule PB.NUM.NAN and it may be
beneficial to run the rules in conjunction with one another.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Erratic Application Behavior

Unexpected numeric results may cause unexpected behavior and create security
holes. See BENEFITS for more information.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore floating point comparisons to "infinity" (default true)
    Double and Float infinity values are unique so comparisons to these values
    are generally safe.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This prevents logic errors that can occur when a floating point comparison's
outcome is changed by the imprecision of the numbers' representation.
Specifically, comparisons involving computed floating point numbers are most
suspect. For example the following expression:
    (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 1)
resolves to false.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class DCF {
    int method(double d) {
        if (d == 1) {  // VIOLATION
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change the types of the numbers being compared or change the comparison
to allow for some imprecision.

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class DCFFixed {
    int method(int d) {  // FIXED
        if (d == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
