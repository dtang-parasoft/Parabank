DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that should use a less specific type declaration to 
accomplish loose coupling. An error is reported if a variable declaration could
use a less specific type. 

Inner classes are not flagged.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is parameterized to extend the functionality of the previous rule, 
which only checks for 'java.util.List', 'java.util.Set' and 
'java.util.SortedMap'. It should no longer flag variable declarations as errors 
if promoting such a variable up the class hierarchy would create a compilation
error.

Notice that variables within abstract classes and interfaces will not be 
checked. Parameters to methods that are overridden in the same file will not be
flagged, but this rule does not check other source files to see if a method is
overridden elsewhere.  Parameters to methods that override other methods will
not be flagged, since generalizing them would make them not override the parent
method. Be cautious when changing parameter types because doing so could 
affect overridden methods.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

Basic Settings
    Variables to check:
        -private fields (enabled)
        -parameters (enabled)
        -caught exceptions (disabled)
        -local variables (enabled)
            NOTE: For the purpose of this rule, 'local variables' does not
            include caught exceptions

    Only check types which implement interfaces (disabled)
        Enabling this parameter will limit reported violations to those that can
        be generalized to an interface. This may be desired as using interfaces
        may further help promote loose coupling. Replacement classes could be
        easily dropped in as long as they implement the same interface.

Types
    Types to check:
        -Consider all types
        -Limit analysis to: (default)
            -java.util.List (enabled)
            -java.util.Map (enabled)
            -java.util.Set (enabled)
            -java.io.InputStream (disabled)
            -java.io.OutputStream (disabled)
            -java.io.Reader (disabled)
            -java.io.Writer (disabled)
            -Extra classes/interfaces to be promoted to:
            (manually add more types to be checked)

Excluded Types
    -Classes/Interfaces to ignore:
    (default 'java.util.Properties', 'java.lang.String', 'java.lang.Object', 'java.util.Stack')
    (manually specify types to be ignored)

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Following this rule promotes loose coupling, which is one of the best Object
Oriented Programming practices. By making the variable declaration type less
specific, you can reduce the code's dependencies. Code with low dependencies
can be more modular and flexible, since a wider variety of class objects 
could be applied to the code (because variable declarations are not very
specific). Some well-known and trusty interfaces/classes-- java.util.Set
for instance-- could be candidates for loose coupling.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.pod;

public class AUVT {
    private ArrayList list = new ArrayList();  //VIOLATION
    private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = 10;

    public void addElement(Object element) {
        if (list.size() &lt; MAX_CAPACITY)
            list.add(element);
        else
            System.out.println("list is filled.");
    }
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

Use a less specific type declaration to achieve loose coupling.

package examples.rules.codsta.pod;

public class AUVTFixed {
    private List list = new ArrayList();  //FIXED
    private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = 10;

    public void addElement(Object element) {
        if (list.size() &lt; MAX_CAPACITY)
            list.add(element);
        else
            System.out.println("list is filled.");
    }
}
