DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rules from this category are deprecated - see METRIC category.

Calculates, for classes and interfaces, the percentage of fields and methods
that have Javadoc comments.

% comments = #comments in a file / (#fields + #methods + 1) * 100
' + 1' is for the class or interface's Javadoc comment.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Jtest will report an error if the value is below 25%.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Every class, interface, method and field should have a Javadoc comment 
associated with it.  Documentation helps users of your code to understand it
better.
