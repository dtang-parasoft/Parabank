DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that a "getter" and "setter" method is defined for each field
of classes which are mapped to database tables in a Hibernate mapping file.  It 
also checks that such classes have a field called "id".  This rule will look for
"getter" and "setter" methods which follow the standard naming conventions 
(i.e., names consisting of the word "get" or "set" followed by the name of the 
field).  A violation will be flagged for each class which is mapped in a 
".hbm.xml" file but does not contain a "getter" and "setter" for each field or 
is missing a field called "id".

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule only checks classes which are mapped in a "Hibernate-mapping"
document.  It looks for these mappings in all files in the tested project whose
names end in the ".hbm.xml" extension.

It is usually better to have Hibernate generate persistent classes.  If 
Hibernate is used to automatically generate classes, it will generate an "id"
field and the appropriate "getter" and "setter" methods with little effort on
behalf of the developer.

This rule was created for use with Hibernate 3.1.  It is not guaranteed to apply
to all versions of Hibernate.  You should not enable this rule if it does not
apply to the version of Hibernate you are using.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is standard for all classes which are mapped in "hibernate-mapping" documents 
to have "getter" and "setter" methods.  Having an "id" field is necessary to
use the full feature set of Hibernate.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This example assumes that there is a mapping for the class "GSIM" in a 
".hbm.xml" file in the tested project.

package examples.rules.hibernate;
         
public class GSIM {  // 2 VIOLATIONS- no "getter" for the "age" field and no
                     // "id" field
    private int age;  
    
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
         

</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Add an "id" field and a "getter" and "setter" method for every field.
       
package examples.rules.hibernate;
         
public class GSIMFixed {  
    private Long id;  //FIXED
    private int age;

    public Long getId() {  
        return id;
    }

    private void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public int getAge() {  //FIXED
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
