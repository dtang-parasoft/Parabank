DESCRIPTION

<PRE>
   
This rule checks that the compound assignment operators ("+=", "-=", "*=", 
"/=", "&amp;=", "|=", "^=", "%=", "&lt;&lt;=", "&gt;&gt;=", or "&gt;&gt;&gt;=") are not used in cases 
that are likely to lead to lost precision or magnitude.  The compound assignment 
operators should not be used at all with destination variables of type "byte", 
"short", or "char" because these datatypes are very narrow and easy to overflow.  
If the destination variable is of the type "int", the expression on the right-
hand side should not be of type "long", "float", or "double" since these 
datatypes are all wider than the "int" datatype.  If the destination variable is
of the type "float", the expression on the right-hand side should not be of type 
"double" since the "double" datatype is wider than the "float" datatype.

When a compound assignment operator is applied to a variable, overflow is very
likely.  This is especially true when the destination variable is of a very 
narrow type or when the type of the expression on the right-hand side is wider
than the type of the destination variable.  An implicit narrowing cast is 
generated in cases where the expression on the right-hand side is of too wide a 
type.  This is likely to lead to bugs, so it is a good idea to follow this rule.

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class CACO {
    public static void meth(short x, int i) {
        double foo = Math.pow(2, 40);
        x += i;                 //VIOLATION- expands to "x = (short)(x + i)",
                                //which is an unsafe cast
        System.err.println(x);
        i += foo;               //VIOLATION- expands to "i = (int)(i + foo)"
                                //which is an unsafe cast
        System.err.println(i);
    }
}

Change the types of the variables so that the types are wide enough to 
perform the compound assignment on with less risk of overflow.  In this case,
changing the types of the parameters to "double" will work.

If you know that there is no possibility for overflow, you should at least 
expand the compound assignment into a standard assignment with a cast to make 
the narrowing cast explicit.  (i.e., Change "x += i" to "x = (short)(x + i)")

package examples.rules.pb.num;

public class CACOFixed {
    public static void meth2(double x, double i) {  //FIXED
        double foo = Math.pow(2, 40);
        x += i;
        System.err.println(x);
        i += foo;
        System.err.println(i);
    }
}
