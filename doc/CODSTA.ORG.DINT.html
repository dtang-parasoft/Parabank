DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects when methods from classes that are marked as internal
are externally accessed.
The rule can be parameterized to specify which classes the rule will
assume to be internal and to list packages you want the rule to ignore
(see PARAMETERS).

You can mark a class as internal in one of the following ways:
- as a string in a comment that precedes the class definition.
- as a custom Javadoc tag.
- as a class annotation.
The rule must be parameterized to specify the string, Javadoc tag and/or
annotation (the default is "internal"); see PARAMETERS.

In addition, you can mark all classes in a package as internal by adding 
the name of the package to the list in the "Internal packages" parameter.

The rule checks the following types of access('B' indicates an internal class):
  - Method calls
  - Use of the "A instanceof B" expression
  - Use of "B.class"
  - Declarations of any variable with a type that is defined in an internal
    file
  - Generic specification such as "ArrayList&lt;B&gt;"
  - Import statements "import B"

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Packages that should not be checked (in regular expressions)
     Allows you to specify packages the rule will ignore. Provide a list of
     packages in regular expressions (the default is ".*nocheck.*").
-Internal packages (in regular expressions)
     Allows you to specify packages the rule will assume to be internal. As
     a result, all classes in the listed packages will be considered to be
     internal (the default is .*internal.*). 

-Annotations to mark internal classes (fully-qualified names)
    Allows you to specify a list of Java annotations the rule will assume to
    be markers of internal classes. Provide a list of fully-qualified
    annotation names in the "Fully-qualified Name of Annotation" table.

Marking internal classes in comments
-Check single-line comments (enabled by default)
-Check C-style comments (enabled by default)
-String to mark internal classes in comments (the default is "internal")

Marking internal classes in Javadoc
-Check Javadoc tags (enabled by default)
-Custom tag to mark internal classes in Javadoc (the default is "@internal")

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

His rule helps you avoid data leakage by ensuring that internal methods are
not externally called 



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the method marked as internal is externally called.

package com.parasoft.codsta.org.dint.examples;

import com.parasoft.internal.InternalExample;

public class DINT {
    void method(){
        new InternalExample().internalMethodCall(); // VIOLATION the InternalExample
                                                    // class is declared in internal package
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, do not use call methods from the class marked as 'internal'.

package com.parasoft.codsta.org.dint.examples;

public class DINTFixed {
    void method(){ // FIXED
    }
}
