DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that calls the threading 'wait()' method without 
an enclosing loop.  It also identifies calls to one of the 'await()' methods 
declared in the "java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition" interface without 
an enclosing loop.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

For the 'wait()' method, if you test your liveness condition before you wait, 
it will not necessarily still be met after your thread is notified.  
Consequently, you should put the condition test in a loop.  This way, when the 
thread awakens, the condition will be retested to ensure that it is safe to 
continue.

For the 'await()' methods of "java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition", the 
condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually 
occurred if the same object is used for multiple conditions.  Thus, the call
to 'await()' should be placed in a loop which checks which condition occurred.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This program demonstrates the need for calls to 'wait()' to be placed in
a while loop with the condition that the thread must satisfy in order to
continue. This way, the woken up thread will check its condition before
continuing.

In this program there is one thread that puts items in the buffer variable,
and two other threads that take an item out of the buffer. When a producer
thread puts an item in the buffer, it will wake up all the consumer threads
that are waiting to consume an item from the buffer. The consumer threads
have to check to make sure they don't consume from an empty buffer. In this
program the consumer threads fail to check this condition when they are
woken up, and this results in the program exiting.

public class UWIL {
    static class Producer implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                int temp = pc.produce();
                System.out.println("Producing. Buffer has " + temp
                        + " item(s) in it");
            }
        }
    }

    static class Consumer implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                int temp = pc.consume();
                if (temp &lt; 0) {
                    System.err.println(
                            "Error: Cannot consume from an empty buffer.");
                    System.exit(1); // buffer cannot get negative
                }
                System.out.println("Consuming. Buffer has " + temp
                        + " item(s) in it");
            }
        }
    }

    static ProducerConsumer pc;

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        pc = new ProducerConsumer();
        new Thread(new Producer()).start();
        new Thread(new Consumer()).start();
        new Thread(new Consumer()).start();
    }

    static class ProducerConsumer {
        volatile int buffer = 0;

        public synchronized int produce() {
            buffer++; // put a new item in the buffer
            notifyAll(); // wake up all the consumers
            return buffer;
        }

        public synchronized int consume() {
            // if the buffer is empty wait for an item
            try {
                if (buffer == 0) { //VIOLATION
                    wait();
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                ;
            }
            buffer--; // consume an item from the buffer
            return buffer;
        }
    }
}

In order to fix the problem, we need to put the call to 'wait()' in a loop.
That way, every time this thread is woken up, it will check the condition first
and will continue when the condition is met.
