DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that static fields are not written to from instance methods.
A violation will be flagged for each write to a static field within an instance
method.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are some cases where it is difficult or impossible to avoid modifying a
static variable from an instance method.  However, it is generally a bad idea to
do this when it is not necessary since it can lead to confusion.  In cases where
violating this rule is necessary, the violation should be suppressed.

This rule will not flag cases where a static variable of the same type as the
enclosing class is modified within an instance method.  It is common practice
to use a static field to track an instance of the enclosing class.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check for write accesses
    -Only to static fields that are declared in the same class (default option)
        -If this option is selected, the rule will only flag write accesses to
         static fields which are declared in the class in which they are written 
         to.  Write accesses to fields from other classes will be ignored.
    -To any static fields   
        -If this option is selected, any write accesses to static fields will
         be flagged (regardless of where the field is declared).

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is tricky to ensure that a static variable has the correct value if  multiple 
instances of a class are all modifying its value.  Because of this, it is 
considered bad practice to write to a static field from an instance method.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.epc;

public class WSIM {
    private static int _countInvs;

    WSIM(){
         _countInvs= 0;
    }

    public void login(){
        _countInvs++;  //VIOLATION
        //log in code
    }
    
    public int getCount(){
        return _countInvs;
    }
}

Note that the variable "_countInvs" here is used to keep track of the number of
times the user calls the "login()" method.  The value of the variable 
"_countInvs" will depend on the number of instances of the class "WSIM" as well
as the number of times each instance calls the "login()" method.  This works 
fine if there is only a single instance of the class "WSIM", but it can lead
to confusion if there are multiple instances.  What was probably meant here is
to keep track of the number of times each instance of the class logs in, which 
should be done with an instance variable.  If this is not the case, the methods
"login()" and "getCount()" should be made static to make it more clear that 
they are accessing/modifying static variables.

REPAIR

<PRE>

Make sure that the variable being modified was supposed to be "static" and that
the method modifying it was supposed to be non-"static".  Either make the method 
that modifies the static field "static" or change the static variable to an 
instance variable.

package examples.rules.codsta.epc;

public class WSIMFixed {
    private int _countInvs;  //FIXED- changed field to non-"static"

    WSIMFixed(){
         _countInvs= 0;
    }

    public void login(){
        _countInvs++;  //VIOLATION
        //log in code
    }
    
    public int getCount(){
        return _countInvs;
    }
}
