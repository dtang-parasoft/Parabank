DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "protected" class members which are declared in "final" 
classes.  An error is flagged for each field or method of a "final" class 
which is given "protected" access.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There is no reason for a member of a "final" class to have "protected" 
access.  It should be given package-private access instead.  The only 
additional access that is allowed by declaring a member as "protected" 
instead of "package-private" is that subclasses can access "protected" 
members.   However, since a "final" class cannot be subclassed, using the
"protected" modifier in a "final" class is pointless and confusing.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.oop;

public final class PIFC {
    protected Object field;  //VIOLATION
    protected void method () {}  //VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use the default access level (package-private) instead of "protected".

package examples.rules.oop;

public final class PIFCFixed {
    Object field;  //FIXED
    void method () {}  //FIXED
}
