DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies utility classes that do not follow the user-defined naming 
convention (as specified in a regular expression). One naming convention used to 
identify utility classes is to add a "U" to the beginning of the class name.  
Another way is to add "Util", "Utility", or "Utilities" to the end of the class 
name.  All of these naming conventions are accepted by default.  An error is 
reported for each utility class which does not follow one of these conventions. 

This rule identifies a class as a utility class if all the methods in the class 
are static.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Pattern of utility class names in regular expression
    -Utility class names should match this expression.
    -The default is "(^U[A-Z])|(Util$)|(Utility$)|(Utilities$)".  This enforces 
     that the names of utility classes follow one of the following two naming 
     conventions:
     1. The name of the class must begin with "U" followed by another capital 
        letter.  OR
     2. The name must end with either "Util", "Utility", or "Utilities". 
-Negate regular expression
    -If this parameter is enabled, a violation will be flagged if the name of a
     utility class matches the specified regular expression.
    -By default, this parameter is off.  This means that a violation will be 
     flagged for utility class names which do not match the regular expression
     specified.
-Ignore case
    -If this parameter is enabled, the regular expression will not be case
     sensitive.
    -By default, this parameter is off.  This means that the names of utility
     classes must match the regular expression specified, including in case.

Change the class name to match the regular expression

package examples.rules.naming;

public class PowersUtil {  //FIXED
    private PowersUtil() {} 
    public static long getSquare(int i) {
