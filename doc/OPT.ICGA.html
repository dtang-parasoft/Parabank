Avoid accessing members which will require synthetic accessor methods [OPT.ICGA]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will flag accesses to inaccessible members.  While not necessarily a
compile error, such accesses should be avoided because they require generation
of a synthetic accessor method.  The Java compiler might actually create one
more accessor class file just to give the nested class access to the private
member of the outer class.

By default, an error is reported when a nested class tries to access a private
constructor, field, or method of the outer class, or vice versa.

NOTES

<PRE>

The Quick Fix for this rule will change the accessibility of the method,
constructor, or field being accessed to "package-private".  For methods,
constructors, and fields defined in inner types, it will also change the
accessibility of the type declaration to "package-private" if accessing this
type would require a generated accessor method.  Also, the Quick Fix will be
applied to any other types of which the accessed type is a member and which must
be changed to "package-private" to avoid generation of a synthetic accessor
method.  In this way, multiple levels of nested "private" types may be changed
to "package-private".

This rule and its Quick Fix may conflict with the rules GLOBAL.DPAC and
SECURITY.INNER for the case of inner "private" types.  The Quick Fix for OPT.ICGA
may change the accessibility of an inner type from "private" to "package-
private".  This may cause GLOBAL.DPAC and/or SECURITY.INNER to instruct you to
change the inner class back from "package-private" to "private" to limit the
accessibility as much as possible.

OPT.ICGA should not be enabled at the same time as either GLOBAL.DPAC or
SECURITY.INNER.  Which rule should be followed depends on which is a higher
priority: efficiency or limiting accessibility.  If efficiency is a priority,
enable this rule.  If limiting accessibility is more of a priority, enable
GLOBAL.DPAC and/or SECURITY.INNER.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, optimizations are especially important.

When resources are scarce, it's not good to have an extra accessor class
generated.

package examples.rules.opt;

public class ICGAFixed {
    ICGAFixed() {}          //changed accessibility to package-private
    class innerClass {
        ICGAFixed obj= new ICGAFixed(); //FIXED
