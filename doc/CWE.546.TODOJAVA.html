DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Many suspicious comments, such as BUG, HACK, FIXME, LATER, LATER2, TODO,
in the code indicate missing security functionality and checking. Others
indicate code problems that programmers should fix, such as hard-coded
variables, error handling, not using stored procedures, and performance
issues." [CWE-546]

This rule detects comments in Java code that indicate that the code development
has not been completed.
By default, the rule reports comments that include the following tags:  "TODO",
"FIXME", "XXX". The rule can be parameterized to report comments that include
custom tags or regular expressions (see PARAMETERS).

"Suspicious comments could be an indication that there are problems in
the source code that may need to be fixed and is an indication of poor
quality. This could lead to further bugs and the introduction of
weaknesses." [CWE-546]

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "List of task tags" table allows you to configure the tags the rule will
detect in comments.
- "Is reg expr" - if enabled, the tag name specified in the "Value" column
    will be treated as a regular expression.
- "Value" - specifies the tag name to be detected.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you ensure that all suspicious comments are resolved before
the development process is completed.
