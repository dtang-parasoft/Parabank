error is reported if the Entity Bean contains more than 5 "public"
instance methods.

NOTES

<PRE>

If an Entity Bean contains more than 5 "public" 
instance methods, it will be considered a fine-grained
object.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Entity Beans are meant to represent coarse-grained 
transactional persistent business components. Using a
remote Entity Bean to represent fine-grained objects
increases the overall network communication and container
overhead. This impacts application performance and
scalability.

Think of a fine-grained object as an object that has little
meaning without its association to another object (typically a 
coarse-grained parent object). For example, an item object can
be thought of as a fined-grained object because it has little 
value until it is associated with an order object. In this example, 
the order object is the coarse-grained object and the item object 
is the fine-grained (dependent) object.
