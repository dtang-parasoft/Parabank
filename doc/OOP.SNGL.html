Use a naming convention for singleton classes [OOP.SNGL]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports violations when a class matches the naming convention specified in the 
parameter ("^.+Singleton$" by default) but does not match the definition of a 
singleton class.  By definition, a singleton class should have only private 
constructors and should have a "static" method to get the singleton instance.  
If either or both of these is missing, an error will be reported.

An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule used to be part of the rule NAMING.SINGLETON.  The part that remains
in that rule is the part that recognizes when a class follows the singleton
pattern, but is not named in such a way that the singleton pattern is evident.
This rule checks for a class with a name that follows the singleton pattern, but
improperly implements the singleton pattern in the code.
Also, this rule took the parameter and quickfix that checks whether a class 
matching the singleton pattern has a getInstance method that is synchronized.
This test may have to be run twice: once to fix the singleton pattern in the
class named like a singleton, and once to fix the synchronization issue with the
 getInstance method.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-regular expression (default value is "^.+Singleton$")
-Check that the method to get the singleton instance is "synchronized" for 
 classes which match the singleton pattern (default is "true")
    -The method in a singleton class to get the singleton instance generally 
     should be "synchronized" to avoid accidentally creating multiple instances
     of a class that was intended to be a singleton.
    -If this parameter is enabled, a violation will be flagged for classes which
     follow the singleton pattern (That is, they have only private constructors
     and have a "static" method to get the singleton instance.) but for which 
     the method to get the singleton instance is not declared "synchronized".  
     Instead of using the "synchronized" keyword in the method signature, it
     is also acceptable to surround the entire body of the method with a 
     "synchronized" block.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It helps to make sure that classes which were intended to be singletons match 
the definition of the singleton pattern.

package examples.rules.OOP;

public class SNGL {
    private static SNGL _s;
    
    private SNGL() {
        
    }
    
    public static SNGL getInstance() {  //FR64782
        _s = new SNGL();
        return _s;
    }
}
class MySingleton {//VIOLATION
    
    private static MySingleton _ss;
    
    private MySingleton(int i) {
        this(i+"");
    }

    public static MySingleton getInstance() {
        MySingleton ss = new MySingleton(1);
        _ss = ss;
        return new MySingleton("");
    }
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Make SNGL's getInstance method synchronized.
Change MySingleton's non-private constructor to private and add accessor method

package examples.rules.oop;

public class SNGL {
    private static SNGL _s;
    
    private SNGL() {
        
    }
    
    public static synchronized SNGL getInstance() {  //FR64782
        _s = new SNGL();
        return _s;
    }
}

class MySingleton {  // FIXED

    private static MySingleton _ncl;
    
    private MySingleton() {
    }
    
    public static synchronized MySingleton getInstance() {
        if (_ss == null) {
            _ss = new MySingleton();
        }
        return _ss;
    }
