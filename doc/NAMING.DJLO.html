DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks for types which have the same name as a type in one of the Java 
platform libraries.  By default, a violation will be flagged for each class, 
interface, annotation, or enum which has the same name as a type in the 
"java.lang" package.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will check the JDK version that is used to compile each project for 
types with the same name as a user-defined type.  Thus, it may produce different 
results when run with different JDK versions.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Packages in the Java platform which should be checked for duplicate type names
    -Specify the full package names here for packages in the Java platform which
     should be checked for types with the same name as user-defined types.
    -The default value is "java.lang".
    -Entries in this list must follow the Java naming convention for packages 
     which are part of the Java platform.  For instance, the list will only 
     accept package names which have one of the prefixes "java", "javax", or 
     "org".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Defining your own types with the same name as a type in the Java platform can
be confusing because the user-defined type will hide the Java platform type when 
the type is accessed using the unqualified name.  This makes the code difficult 
to read because the reader will assume that all unqualified type names refer to 
the standard types in the Java platform.  This may not be the case if there is a 
user-defined type with the same name that is visible.  This is especially true 
for type names in the "java.lang" package since the "java.lang" package is 
implicitly imported in every Java file.  Reusing names from the Java platform 
can also easily lead to bugs.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This example looks like it should print out "10", but it really prints out "0" 
because the user has defined his own class with the name "Integer".

package examples.rules.naming;

class DJLO {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer foo = new Integer(10);
        System.out.println(foo.intValue());
    }
}

class Integer {  //VIOLATION
    int value;

    Integer(int i) {
        value = i;
    }

    public int intValue() {
        return 0;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change the name of the user-defined type to something unique.

package examples.rules.naming;

class DJLOFixed {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer foo = new Integer(10);
        System.out.println(foo.intValue());
    }
}

class MyInteger {  //FIXED
    int value;

    MyInteger(int i) {
        value = i;
    }

    public int intValue() {
        return 0;
    }
}
