DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies classes that do not have a "final" readObject()
method. An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES

<PRE>

This rule will report violations for many of the same cases that the rule 
SECURITY.OROM will report if the "Check that the 'readObject()' method is 
implemented in all serializable classes." parameter for SECURITY.OROM is 
enabled.  Both rules check that the 'readObject()' method is implemented; 
however, they are both included in Jtest because the proposed fix for them is 
different.  SECURITY.OROM instructs you to provide an actual implementation of 
the 'readObject()' method while this rule just instructs you to provide a stub 
implementation of 'readObject()' which throws an exception.  It is not 
necessary to enable both this rule and SECURITY.OROM with the "'readObject()'"
parameter enabled.  You should decide whether serializable classes should 
provide a working implementation of 'readObject()' or just a stub implementation
and enable the appropriate rule.

According to McGraw and Felten, 
"Even if your class is not serializeable, it may still be deserializeable.
An adversary can create a sequence of bytes that happens to deserialize to
an instance of your class. This is dangerous, since you do not have control
over what state the deserialized object is in. You can think of deserialization
as another kind of public constructor for your object; unfortunately it is a kind
of constructor that is difficult for you to control."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.security.wsc;

public class DSER {
    public void setValue(int value) {
        _value = value;
    }
    private int _value;

    // VIOLATION : missing readObject()
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Add a "final" readObject() method.

package examples.rules.security.wsc;

import java.io.*;

public class DSERFixed {
    public void setValue(int value) {
        _value = value;
    }
    private int _value;

    private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream out)
        throws IOException {  // FIXED
            throw new IOException("Object cannot be deserialized");
    }

}
