DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies any "class" or "interface" that lacks Javadoc comments
or descriptions within the Javadoc comments.
An error is reported for each occurrence.

v6.0


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Quick Fix All" feature is not always available for this rule because some
of the Quick Fixese require user input.  These cases must be Quick Fixed
individually.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check if javadoc comment is missing (default as true)
-Check if javadoc description is missing (default as false)
    Javadoc should give a brief description of the commenting class or interface.

-check "public" types (default as true)
-check "protected" types (default as false)
-check "package-private" types (default as false)
-check "private" types (default as false)

-Ignore types with fully qualified names (in regular expression)
    Allows you to provide a list of class, interfaces, enum, annotation to ignore.
    If a class or interface has a fully qualified name that matches any of the
    regular expressions, it will be exempt from this rule. For example, if
    ".*internal.*" is added to the list, then any class or interface that has
    "internal" as a part of its fully qualified name would not be identified
    as a rule violation-- even if it does not have Javadoc.

-Ignore member types (default as false)
    Prevents this rule from checking member type declarations. "Member type" refers
    to a class, interface, enum, annotation that is declared directly within another type declaration.

-Ignore local classes (default as false)
    Prevents this rule from checking local type declarations. "Local classes" refers
    to a class that is declared directly within another method declaration.
