DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>


Disallows using deprecated methods from the classes 'Thread' and 'Runtime'.  Several
methods in these classes have been deprecated because they are either deadlock-prone
or have not been implemented.  The method calls which this rule checks for are
'Thread.resume()', 'Thread.stop()', 'Thread.suspend()', 'Thread.destroy()', and 
'Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit()'.

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

These deprecated and deadlock-prone calls can result in denial
of service conditions.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

These methods have been deprecated because they are unsafe and deadlock-prone or 
(in the case of 'Thread.destroy()') have not even been implemented.  The Javadoc for 
'Thread.destroy()' states that the method has not been implemented but that, if it 
were to be implemented, it would be deadlock-prone.  If you call 'Thread.destroy()', 
it will just throw a "NoSuchMethodError" (which is obviously not the desired effect).
