DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

Introduced by Thomas McCabe, cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly
independent paths through which messages can pass.The result of this measurement
is a single ordinal number that can be used to compare the cyclomatic complexity
across programs. A program module's complexity can also be interpreted as the cost
of producing test cases for the code. 

Methods with low cyclomatic complexity imply that decisions are deferred through
message passing--though this does not imply that a method is not complex or intricate.
Methods with a high complexity tend to be more difficult to understand, maintain,
and test; thus complex methods adversely affect an application's reliability. 

This metric is computed by counting the number of decisions in the flow graph and
incrementing the number by one, as in the following formula:

MCC = Number of decisions + 1

For this metric, each occurrence of the following expressions counts as
a decision point:
- if, for, while, do-while, switch
- catch
- conditional operator a?b:c

A high number of decisions makes code difficult to understand and maintain.

                        str = "correct";
                    }

                    case 0:
                        return "nothing";
                    case 1:
                        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
                }
                return str;
