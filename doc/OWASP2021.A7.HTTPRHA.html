DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This attack-focused weakness is caused by improperly implemented
authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks. . .
If an attacker is able to spoof the IP, they may be able to bypass
the authentication mechanism." [CWE-290]

Relying on HTTP request headers such as X-Forwarded-For, True-Client-IP,
and X-Real-IP to identify the remote IP address of the connecting client is
prone to IP address spoofing, which may allow an attacker to bypass
authentication. To avoid security attacks, you need to use more secure methods
of identifying clients, such as configuring appropriate access controls on
the server.

This rule detects invocations of the following methods:
- the getHeader(java.lang.String) and getHeaders(java.lang.String) methods
  from the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest class that are called with
  one of the following arguments defined as a Sting literal or a final String
  variable:
    - X-Forwarded-For
    - True-Client-IP
    - X-Real-IP
- the getRemoteAddr() method from the javax.servlet.ServletRequest class

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This weakness can allow an attacker to access resources which are not
otherwise accessible without proper authentication." [CWE-290]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you comply with some security standards and ensure that
your application is not exposed to common IP spoofing attacks.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

public class HTTPHSB {

    public String getClientIPAddress(HttpServletRequest request) {
        final String ipAddress = request.getHeader("X-Forwarded-For");
        return ipAddress;
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not use the HTTP request headers to identify the connecting client.
