DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies possible typos in overriding method names.
Only differences in one character would be recognized
as possible typos. However, method names that have the same spelling but
differ in lowercase/uppercase will be flagged (even if they are off by
more than one character). For example, method 'testRHS' would be flagged
if there's a method 'testRhs' in the parent class.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule may report the same violation as PB.CUB.EOOM, if the method being
overridden belongs to java.lang.Object.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

- Method name pairs to be ignored (Regular Expressions)
  Some method names are similar but should not be considered as
  typo variants of each other.
  By default, the list contains:
  print(),paint()
  clone(),close()


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If the overriding method is incorrectly spelled, it will not
be called; instead, the method from the superclass will be called.
In the example below, the 'finalize' method for this subclass is
misspelled, so the cleanup code will not be executed.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class IMO {
    // VIOLATION: should be 'finalize'
    protected void finallize () throws Throwable {
        // important cleanup code
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Fix the typo, or suppress the error message.

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class IMOFixed {
    protected void finalize () throws Throwable { // FIXED
        // important cleanup code
    }
}
