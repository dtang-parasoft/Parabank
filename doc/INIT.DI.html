DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies cases where a field is initialized both in its declaration
and also in a constructor.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v8.4


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule was formerly a parameter of INIT.CSI.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Maximum level of checking allowed (default is 4)
    -Note that constructors may call setter methods to initialize field values.
     In turn, these methods may call other methods. As a result, a large number
     of methods may be involved. This parameter allows controlling the extent to
     which this is checked. Specifying a higher value may yield more accurate
     results, but will likely increase the time to run the rule.

-Check non-static fields (default is true)
-Check static fields (default is false)
-Ignore fields initialized with default values (default is true)
    -Enabling this parameter will ignore fields which are set to their default
     values. Default values are considered to be:
          array = null
          primitive boolean = false
          primitive number = 0
          non-primitive object = null


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Fields which are double initialized may be unintended and cause confusion about
which value the field is initialized to. There may also be a performance penalty
by initializing the variable twice.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.init;

public class DI {
    private int NUM = 5;

    public DI() {
        NUM = 10; //VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Determine which value was intended and initialize only once.

package examples.rules.init;

public class DIFixed {
    private int NUM;

    public DIFixed() {
        NUM = 10; //FIXED
    }
}
