DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies confusing usage of overloading.  There are three different 
cases that can potentially be caught by this rule.  Which cases are actually 
caught depends on the setting of the parameters.  The three cases are:

1.  Multiple overloadings of a method have the same number of parameters.

    This is the most general case.  Any methods which fit the description of 
    case 2 and/or case 3 must also fit this case.  The strictest policy possible
    is to enforce that multiple overloadings do not have the same number of
    parameters.
    
2.  Multiple overloadings of a method have the same number and types of 
    parameters (with the types in different orders)
    
    This case is a subset of case 1.  If two overloadings match this 
    description, the caller of the overloaded methods may get confused between 
    the two overloadings and accidentally call the wrong overloading.
    
3.  Multiple overloadings of a method have the same number of parameters, and
    the type of each parameter of one of the overloadings is assignable to the 
    corresponding parameter type of the other method.  
    
    This case is also a subset of case 1 and is the most serious violation of
    the three types of violation.  This case is the most likely to lead to bugs.
    For an explanation of this, see the BENEFITS section.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule may flag some false positives in cases where the implementations of 
two overloaded methods are the same (or one overloading just calls the other). 
In this case, it is not necessary to follow this rule.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-What to Flag
    -Flag any overloaded methods with the same number of parameters.
        -If this option is selected, the rule will check for case 1 as described
         in the DESCRIPTION section. 
    -Flag only certain cases where two overloadings can be easily confused. 
     (default option)
        -Flag overloaded methods if they have the same number and types of 
         parameters. (default is true)
            -If this option is selected, the rule will check for case 2 as 
             described in the DESCRIPTION section.
        -Flag overloaded methods where the same set of parameters can be passed 
         to different overloadings using casts. (default is true)
            -If this option is selected, the rule will check for case 3 as 
             described in the DESCRIPTION section.
        
Note: The options "Flag overloaded methods if they have the same number and 
types of parameters." and "Flag overloaded methods where the same set of 
parameters can be passed to different overloadings using casts." are only 
available when "Flag only certain cases where two overloadings can be easily 
confused." is selected.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Following this rule should prevent the confusion and errors that result
from having overloaded methods with the same number of parameters, especially
if the parameters are of compatible types.  Consider the following example.

Say you have the following two methods in a class:
    
    public String getType (Object obj) {
        return "Object";
    }

    public String getType (String str) {
        return "String";
    } 
    
This code matches case 3 from the DESCRIPTION section.  Say you have some code 
in this class which calls these methods as follows:
    
    Object o= new String();
    System.err.println(getType(o));

The decision on which overloaded method to call is made based on the 
compile-time type of the parameter.  Even though the runtime type of the 
variable "o" is "String", the overloaded method which takes "Object obj" as its 
parameter will be called since this decision is made at compile-time.  This is
probably not what was expected and is confusing.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

One strategy for allowing an algorithm to accept different types of input
is to write overloaded methods that accept parameters of different types.
Users only need to learn the signature of the general method and do not
need to remember any signature variations from method to method.  Java's
String class provides such a method for the conversion of numeric types
to Strings, 'valueOf ()', which takes any basic numeric type as a parameter.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.epc;

import java.util.*;

public class OVERLOAD {
    public void method (ArrayList al) {}  // VIOLATION
    public void method (Collection c) {}  // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Differentiate the methods by either renaming them or changing the number
of parameters.

package examples.rules.codsta.epc;

import java.util.*;

public class OVERLOADFixed {
    public void arrayListMethod (ArrayList al) {}  // FIXED
    public void collectionMethod (Collection c) {}  // FIXED
}
