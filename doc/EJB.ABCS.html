Implementation details specific to one tier should not be
introduced in another tier. The service API exposed by the
business tier to the presentation tier will likely be used
by other clients as well. If the service API accepts 
parameters with types, such as HttpServletRequest, then
every client to the service is forced to package its data
in a servlet request data structure. This drastically 
reduces the service's reusability.
