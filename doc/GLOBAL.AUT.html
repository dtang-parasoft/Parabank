Avoid unused "throws" clauses [GLOBAL.AUT]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "throws" clauses that are not used.
An error is reported if the method has a "throws" clause and the
exception is not:

1) Explicitly thrown in the method body, or

2) Specified in the "throws" clause of a method invoked in the
method's body.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will ignore "abstract" and overridden methods.

The Quick Fix for this rule might cause "Unreachable catch block" compilation
errors.  The "Quick Fix All" option is enabled for convenience, but you should be
careful using it.  You may have to fix compilation errors that result from
applying the Quick Fix.  You should remove the unreachable "catch" block manually
for all cases where a compilation error results from removing the unnecessary
"throws" clause.

Also, to avoid causing further problems, the "Quick Fix All" feature will stop
applying the Quick Fix to violations within a file once a Quick Fix for a violation
causes a compilation error in that file.  Thus, it is possible that not all of
the violations will be Quick Fixed even when "Quick Fix All" is applied.  You
should run "Quick Fix All" on a file again after you fix any generated compilation
errors in that file.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore overriding and implementing methods (default is true)
-Allow exceptions to be declared as thrown if a subtype is thrown (default is
 true)
    -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will check the method body to see
     if the declared exception type or any of its subtypes is thrown.  If it is
     not enabled, the rule will just check for the declared exception type.
-Allow unchecked exceptions to be declared as thrown (default is false)
    -If this parameter is enabled, unchecked exceptions will be allowed in the
     "throws" declaration even if no statement or method call explicitly throws
     that exception type.  An unchecked exception is defined as any subclass of
     "java.lang.Error" or "java.lang.RuntimeException".  While it is not
     recommended that you declare unchecked exceptions to be thrown, you may
     want to do so to inform the caller of what exceptions are possible when
     invoking a method.
-Ignore exception list(in regular expression)


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Code that violates this rule is incorrect. It either has a "throws" clause that
should be removed, or a method body that is not doing what was intended.

package examples.rules.global;

class AUT {
    public void setValue (int value)
        throws IOException  // VIOLATION: exception not thrown in the method body
    {
        _value = value;
    }
    public void setName (String name)
        throws IllegalArgumentException
    {
        // VIOLATION: forgot to add the code that checks the 'name' argument
        _name = name;
    }
}
