DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies method declarations which do not contain required 
authentication method invocations. An error is reported for each declaration
matching one of the user-specified regular expressions which does not contain a 
call to a centralized authentication method (Centralized authentication methods 
are specified in the parameters).

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is meant to be parameterized with naming conventions by the 
application architect to enforce consistent authentication operation in an 
application.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Weak Security Controls
category: Code Quality

Authentication should be consistently applied in user management methods.

Enforcing this rule will help to protect against many of the OWASP Top 10 
application vulnerabilities, such as:

A4-Insecure Direct Object Reference
A7-Missing Function Level Access Control

This rule helps to enforce the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard) Requirement #6: "Develop and maintain secure systems and applications"
and Requirement #8: "Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access".
Specifically, this rule helps to test for Issue 6.5.3: "Broken authentication 
and session management" and Issue 8.5: "Ensure proper user authentication and 
password management for non-consumer users and administrators on all system 
components as follows:".

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Authentication checking method names (in regular expressions)
 [qualified name of declaring type#method name]
    -The methods which must call one of the methods listed in "Centralized 
     authentication method names" parameter.  A violation will be flagged if
     none of the methods listed in the "Centralized authentication method names"
     parameter are called from these authentication checking methods.
    -By default, the list is empty.  Custom values should be added to the list
     by the application architect.

-Centralized authentication method names (in regular expressions)
 [qualified name of declaring type#method name]
    -The methods which must be called from the methods listed in the 
     "Authentication checking method names" parameter.  A violation will be 
     flagged if none of the methods listed in this parameter are called from 
     the methods listed in the "Authentication checking method names" parameter.
    -By default, the list is empty.  Custom values should be added to the list
     by the application architect.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A consistent authentication rule can be used to enforce protected entry points.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If the parameters for this rule are not set, this rule will not flag any 
violations.  This test case assumes the following settings of the parameters:

Centralized authentication method names (in regular expressions)
----------------------------------------------------------------
examples\.rules\.security.\wsc\.PAC#^authentication$

Authentication checking method names (in regular expressions)
-----------------------------------------------------
examples\.rules\.security.\wsc\.PAC#authenticationMethod

package examples.rules.security.wsc;

public class PAC {
    public void authentication(String u) {
        //the centralized authentication method
    }
    public void authenticationMethod(String u) {
        authentication(u);    
    }
    public void authenticationMethodTwo(String u) {
        //VIOLATION- centralized authentication method not called from 
        //authentication checking method
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Always call authentication methods to enforce consistent operation in any 
method specified in the "Authentication checking method names" parameter.

package examples.rules.security.wsc;

public class PACFixed {
    public void authentication(String u) {
        //the centralized authentication method
    }
    public void authenticationMethod(String u) {
        authentication(u);    
    }
    public void authenticationMethodTwo(String u) {
        authentication(u);    //FIXED
    }
}
