DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies text labels in "switch" statements. An error is reported
for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Quick Fix All" feature is not available for this rule because there are
some cases where Quick Fixing the violation would cause a compile error.  For
instance, if a label was really meant to be a label instead of a switch case,
changing the label could cause a compile error.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A label is a line of code that is marked by a label such as 'mark:' and that
can be jumped to by a "break" statement.  A "case" statement such as 'case 5:'
is one typo away from being the label "case5:", which will change the behavior
of the "switch" statement.

Labels that are not typos should not appear in "switch" statements because
they will not be used.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class TLS {
    static int method (int i) {
        switch (i) {
        case 4:
        case3:  // VIOLATION: label typo
            i++;
            break;
        case 25:
        unusedlabel:  // VIOLATION: unused label.
            break;
        }
        return i;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change "case3" to "case 3" and remove the unused label.

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class TLSFixed {
    static int method (int i) {
        switch (i) {
        case 4:
        case 3:  // FIXED
            i++;
            break;
        case 25:
        // FIXED
            break;
        }
        return i;
    }
