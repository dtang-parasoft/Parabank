separators flagged are "\n" and "\r" or any combination of the two.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

These violations can be fixed by storing individual lines or paragraphs as
separate properties. If the concern is length, then the code should perform
line-breaking and wrapping and the message should be stored as a single property
value without separators.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Various operating systems may use differing line separators and hard-coding them
into property files can cause unexpected or incorrect behavior. The user may
also have code intended to gather the values and convert them to proper line
separators. However, often times this code is accidentally omitted or bypassed
and the properties file may also contain line separators other than the standard
separator.

Replace the key with two keys.

#FIXED - removed "\n" character
HCLS_key=The value of this key is:
