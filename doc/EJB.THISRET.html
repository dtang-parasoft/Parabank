A bean class should not return "this" from a method. 
Although not strictly a restriction (the container will 
not prevent you from doing it), it is identified as being 
a very bad practice. Clients should only be able to invoke
bean class methods through its container (remote interface). 
However, by returning the "this" reference, it could potentially 
give a client a direct remote reference to the bean 
rather than the EJBObject.

Use 'getEJBObject ()' available in SessionContext or EntityContext.
