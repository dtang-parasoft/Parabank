Suppose that your enterprise bean needs to pass a reference
to itself to another bean. You might want to pass the 
reference, for example, so that the second bean can call 
the first bean's methods. You can't pass the this reference 
because it points to the bean's instance, which is running 
in the EJB container. Only the container can directly invoke
methods on the bean's instance. Clients access the instance 
indirectly by invoking methods on the object whose type is 
the bean's remote interface. It is the reference to this 
object (the bean's remote reference) that the first bean 
would pass to the second bean.

Use 'getEJBObject()' available in SessionContext or EntityContext.
