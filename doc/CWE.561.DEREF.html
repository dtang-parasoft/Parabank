Do not check for null after dereferencing [CWE.561.DEREF]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects cases where a reference checked for being null gets dereferenced
on any path leading to this check.

In some cases, the checks for null might have become redundant in the course of
refactorings. In other cases, it is possible that the dereference got introduced
into the code that already had the null check, but the developer mistakenly added
the dereference before the null check. This usually results in a null reference
exception. In any case, such a condition usually identifies some inconsistency in
the code and deserves to be reviewed for correctness.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

When both the dereference and the null check are within the same method,
this almost always indicates a problem with the logic. When one of these
is in a different method, a more careful review is needed before 
proceeding to fix the reported violation. This is because, even though,
an obvious solution may be to remove the null check, it is possible that
the null check is a protection against future changes.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To understand the parameters for this rule, we need to first
understand how this rule works.

This rule works by examining the null checks present in the code
and determining whether they are redundant or not. For this,
it examines all the code paths that lead to the null check (say
of variable "foo"). If along all these paths, it finds a dereferencing 
of the variable "foo", then it reports a violation.

Because of this, if Flow Analysis assumes that calls to all the methods
are present in the current code base, it can report violations
aggressively. If on the other hand it assumes that methods can 
get arbitrary values passed into them, it will report the least
number of violations, but you can expect the reported violations
to be lot more accurate.

Flow Analysis can be configured to assume that the following methods
can be passed arbitrary values:

   * none (i.e. all the method calls are assumed to be present in the
           current code base - most aggressive)
   * public 
   * public, protected  
   * public, protected, package-private
   * methods of any visibility (least aggressive, most accurate) [DEFAULT]

Choosing the default option will result in fewer
violations being reported, and a very low number of false
positives. Choosing "public, protected, package-private"
also usually produces good results. You may want
to try different options and pick the one best suited to your
code base.

Helps you detect code that is fraught with the danger of null dereferencing and find
fragments of dead code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The code excerpt below triggers a violation.

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Example
{
    public void doStuff(Collection&lt;Integer&gt; collection)
    {
        Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; it = collection.iterator(); // DEREFERENCE POINT
        // perform some actions
        if (null != collection) { // VIOLATION
            collection.notifyAll();
        }
    }
}

Here, the parameter "c" is used to call the "iterator()" method. It
is later checked for being null.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To repair the code, the developer must decide whether it is possible that at 
the point where a call to "c.iterator()" is made, the variable "c" holds a null 
reference. If that is not the case (because the method "doStuff()" can never be
called with a null parameter), it is sufficient to just remove the useless null
check noted by the violation. However, if it is possible that a null parameter value
can be passed to the "doStuff()" method, the developer must rearrange the code
so that the null check with appropriate actions is performed before the call
to "c.iterator()", not after it.

Here is an example of repaired code for the case when null can be passed into "doStuff()":

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Vector;

public class Repair
{
    public void doStuff(Collection&lt;Integer&gt; collection)
    {
        if (null == collection) {
            collection = new Vector&lt;Integer&gt;();
            // initialize collection
        }
        Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; it = collection.iterator();
        // perform some actions
        collection.notifyAll();
    }
}
