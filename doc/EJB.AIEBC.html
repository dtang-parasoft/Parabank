DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies excessive inter-entity bean communication.
An error is reported if an entity bean references another entity bean.

Entity beans have significantly more overhead than plain
Java objects. Class to entity bean methods are remote and
incur network overhead. Also, entity beans must interact
with an external data source. Even if two entity beans are
in the same container, remote method invocation semantics
apply (the container is involved in the communication) when
one entity bean calls the other bean. Some container 
implementations may optimize such calls because they recognize
that the call comes from an object within the same container,
but this is vendor-specific and cannot be relied upon.
Another issue is that entity bean is not able to demarcate
a transaction. When using entity beans, you are only allowed to
have container-managed transactions. This means that, depending
on the transaction attribute of the entity bean method, the
container may start a new transaction, participate in the
current transaction, or do neither. When a client invokes a
method on an entity bean, the transaction includes the chain
of dependent entity beans and binds them into the transaction's
context. This reduces the performance throughput of the entity
beans as a whole, because any transaction may lock multiple
entity beans and possibly introduce deadlock situations.
