DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies interfaces with no fields or methods (marker interfaces).  
An error is reported for each occurrence.  By default, the rule will not report 
any violations for interfaces which extend two or more other interfaces.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore interfaces which extend at least this many other interfaces:
    -Default is "true", and default value is 2.
    -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will not flag a violation if an
     interface extends at least the specified number of other interface types. 
     Such interfaces are not really marker interfaces even if they do not define
     any methods or fields of their own.  Instead, they are combinations of 
     different interfaces.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Interfaces should include at least one method because implementing an interface 
generally implies that you are providing a concrete implementation of some type.  
Marker interfaces can be confusing since they are only used to provide type 
information.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.oop;

public interface MI {  //VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Add a field or method to the interface, or delete the interface altogether and 
provide some other way to get the type information that the interface provides.

package examples.rules.oop;

public interface MI_Fixed {  //FIXED
    void foo();
}
