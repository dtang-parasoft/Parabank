DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that does not have the required number of blank lines
between the following major sections of a compilation unit and class declaration:

sections in compilation unit:
1) File header.
2) "package" statement.
3) "import" statements.
4) top-level class".
5) top-level interface.
6) top-level Enum.
7) top-level Annotation.

sections in class declaration:
1) field declarations
2) method declarations
3) Member class declarations
4) Member interface declarations
5) Enum constant declarations
6) Annotation member type declarations
7) Member enum declarations
8) Member annotation declarations

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Blank lines in compilation unit
  -A table which allows you to configure the number of blank line(s) for 
   each major section:
     1. package statement (default value is 2 blank lines)
     2. import statements (default value is 2 blank lines)
     3. top-level classes (default value is 2 blank lines)
     4. top-level interfaces (default value is 2 blank lines)
     5. top-level Enum (default value is 2 blank lines)
     6. top-level Annotation (default value is 2 blank lines)
  -To skip checking the number of blank lines before a type of section, uncheck 
   the box next to that section in the "Enforce section?" column.  (By default, 
   all sections are checked.)

-Blank lines in class declaration
  -A table which allows you to configure the number of blank line(s) for
   each major section
     1. field declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     2. method declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     3. member class declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     4. member interface declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     5. declaration of same kind (default value is 0 blank lines)
     6. Enum constant declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     7. Annotation member type declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     8. Member enum declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
     9. Member annotation declarations (default value is 1 blank lines)
  -To skip checking the number of blank lines before a type of section, uncheck 
   the box next to that section in the "Enforce section?" column.  (By default, 
   all sections are checked.)
     
-Check amount of blank lines between consecutive statements (default is false)
   -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will check that the specified number
    of blank lines is present between consecutive statements.  Comment lines 
    immediately preceding a statement are ignored when counting the number of 
    blank lines before a statement.  If there is a comment line between a 
    statement and the previous statement that does not immediately precede the
    statement, no violation will be flagged since it is unclear where the blank
    lines should go in this case.
   -Default number of blank lines is 1.
-Recognize non javadoc comment (default is false)
   -If this parameter is enabled, non javadoc comments will be treated the same
    as javadoc comments.
