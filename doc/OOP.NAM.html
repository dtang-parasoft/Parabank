DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "abstract" classes that do not contain at least one 
"abstract" method.  The rule will flag a violation for each class which meets
all of the following conditions:

1.  The class is declared "abstract".
2.  There are no "abstract" methods defined within the class.
3.  There are no "abstract" methods inherited from "abstract" superclasses.
4.  There are no "abstract" methods from implemented interfaces for which no
concrete implementation is provided.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

If there are no "abstract" methods in a class and the class does not inherit any 
"abstract" methods from "abstract" superclasses or interfaces, there is no point 
in declaring the class "abstract".  "Abstract" classes should provide at least 
one "abstract" method which concrete subclasses must implement in order to 
extend the class.  If there is no such method, it is confusing and unnecessary 
to declare the class "abstract".  An "abstract" class with no "abstract" methods 
usually indicates that someone forgot to add an "abstract" method or that the 
class was accidentally declared "abstract".

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.oop;

public abstract class NAM {  //VIOLATION: This "abstract" class does not contain 
                             //any "abstract" methods.
    public void foo(){}
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are three possible repairs:

1. Remove the "abstract" keyword from the class declaration.
2. Declare one of the existing methods "abstract".
3. Add an "abstract" method.

Which one of these solutions is appropriate depends on the situation.  Fixes #2 
and #3 are shown below.

package examples.rules.oop;

public abstract class NAMFixed { //FIXED 
    public void foo(){}
    public abstract void foo2();
}

or... 

package examples.rules.oop

public abstract class NAMFixed { //FIXED
   public abstract void foo();
}
