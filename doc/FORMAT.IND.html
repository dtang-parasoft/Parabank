DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies lines that are not indented by the correct number of
spaces.  An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES

<PRE>

This rule enforces the following aspects of indentation:

- Spaces or tabs must be used for indentation
- One indentation level is exactly one tab, the number of spaces specified in
  the "Indentation size" parameter
- Indentation must correctly reflect the nesting structure of the source file

Generally, braces and parentheses will determine the nesting level and, 
therefore, the expected indentation.  This means that, each time an open 
parenthesis ("(") or open brace ("{") is encountered, the rule will require an 
extra level of indentation for each proceeding line until the corresponding 
close parenthesis (")") or close brace ("}") is encountered.  This algorithm can 
be changed by customizing the parameter settings.

There are a number of exceptions for some commonly used indentation patterns:

- Javadoc comments may contain an additional space before a star/asterisk
- Non-Javadoc comments are excluded from indentation checking
- 'if/else', 'for', 'while', and 'do/while' may also be used without braces
  (correct indentation will still be enforced)
- 'else if' requires only one indentation, even though the 'if' is
  technically nested inside the 'else'
- In a 'switch' statement, all enclosed code is indented by one level; only
  'case' and 'default' statements appear at the same indentation level as
  the enclosing 'switch'
- Lines that contain only whitespace are excluded from indentation checking
- Continuations of expression statements, variable declaration statements,
  field declarations, and type declaration headers that had to be split
  across two or more lines may have an additional indentation.  By default,
  this additional indentation is optional.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Indentation size (default value is 4)
-Additional levels of indentation for wrapped line continuations (default value
 is 2)
    -For statements which span multiple lines, it is common practice to indent
     every line except for the first by an extra level of indentation (or more).
     The rule will not flag a violation if the extra indentation for lines after
     the first line matches the level specified in this parameter.  This extra
     indentation is optional by default.
    -The default value of the parameter is 2, meaning one extra level of
     indentation (8 spaces by default) is allowed for each line after the first.
-Require additional level(s) of indentation for wrapped line continuations
 (default is false)
   -By default, this parameter is disabled.  This means that additional level(s)
    of indentation for each line after the first line in a statement that is
    split across multiple lines is optional.
   -When this parameter is enabled, the additional level(s) of indentation for
    each line after the first line in a statement that is split across multiple
    lines is mandatory.
-Require an additional level of indentation for each "(" encountered in a
 wrapped line continuation (default is true)
   -By default, the rule will require an extra level of indentation for each "("
    encountered until the corresponding ")" is encountered in multi-line
    statements (See the "NOTES" section for a more detailed explanation).
    However, many people prefer to have each line after the first line in a
    multi-line statement indented at the same level regardless of how many open
    parentheses there are.  This style is better if your code has a lot of
    multi-line statements with a lot of open parentheses in it (meaning
    indenting an extra level for each open parenthesis is impractical).  If you
    prefer to have every line of a multi-line statement after the first line
    indented at the same level, you should turn this parameter off.
-Ignore additional indentation caused by array declaration brackets (the default is true)
   -by default, the rule requires one indentation per each pair of curly brackets. This may
    significantly increase the number of indentations per line if array declarations are split
    into several lines. If array dimensions are assigned with values in separate lines,
    the number of indentations in each line must equal the number of dimensions.
    This parameter allows you to limit the number of indentations. If it is set to 'false',
    the rule will ignore brackets in array declarations.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

If all team members follow the same formatting style, it will be easier for each
team member to read and understand the code.
