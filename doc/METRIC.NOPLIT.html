DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Number of Physical Lines metrics measures the total number of lines. It covers all
kinds of lines: source code lines, lines with comments, and blank lines.
This metric measures the number of physical lines that belong to types.
It includes comments that precede the types.

All nested types are reported separately, thus lines of nested types belong to the nested type only. In
the 'Nested types' example, separate values are reported for class Foo and class Bar.

Anonymous types belong to the closest regular (nested or not) type. In the 'Anonymous Types' example part, class
Foo has 10 lines and no other type is reported.
