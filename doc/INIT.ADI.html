DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects the problem of "double initialization" of fields.  There are 
many different examples of double initialization.  Two cases which are likely to
lead to bugs are:

1.  A field is explicitly initialized in its declaration and also initialized by 
a call to a superclass' constructor.  First, the superclass' constructor will be
called.  Note that the call to the superclass' constructor could be implicit 
since "super()" will automatically be called for constructors which do not have 
an explicit call to the superclass' constructor.  The superclass will then call 
an "abstract" or interface method that is overridden or implemented in the 
subclass.  This allows the superclass to initialize fields in the subclass.  If 
the field is also explicitly initialized in its declaration, it is usually a 
bug.  The value to which the field is explicitly initialized in its declaration 
will overwrite the value to which it is initialized in the constructor (since 
the superclass' constructor is executed before the initializations in the 
current class).  Overwriting the value to which the field is initialized in the 
superclass' constructor is usually not what was intended.  For a concrete 
example of this, see the "EXAMPLE" section below.

2.  A field that is a member of some class is initialized by a call to a 
superclass' constructor and then also initialized by the class' own constructor.
Since the superclass' constructor is executed before the constructor of the
class which declares the field, this will lead to the value that the superclass'
constructor initialized the field to being overwritten.  This is similar to how 
the value to which the field gets initialized is overwritten in Case #1 as 
described above.  

This rule will flag a violation for each field which is both explicitly 
initialized either in the field's declaration or in a constructor and also 
initialized by a call to a superclass' constructor.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Maximum depth of checking allowed
    -The default value is 7, which is enough to catch most errors without making 
     the rule too slow.
    -A constructor may call another method or constructor, which may call 
     another method or constructor, and so on.  To find all the fields which are
     initialized, this rule needs to analyze all the called methods; however, 
     the rule would be too slow if all such method calls were analyzed to an 
     unlimited depth.  This parameter allows you to specify a maximum depth to 
     prevent the rule from taking too long while analyzing nested method calls.
    -You should only adjust this parameter if you find that the rule is taking 
     too long or missing some errors.  If the rule is taking too long, you 
     should decrease the value of the parameter.  If it is missing some errors,
     you should increase the value.

The double initialization situation described in the "DESCRIPTION" section is 
often a bug.  It is easy to get confused about what value the field will have
when a field is explicitly initialized either in its constructor or in its 
declaration and also initialized by the constructor of a superclass.  Even if a
particular case of double initialization is not a bug, it is still pointless to
initialize the same field twice.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this example, the 'init()' method is called before "a" is explicitly 
initialized to "null".  This means that the explicit initialization to "null"
will overwrite the initialization to "foo".  It looks like the code should print
out "foo", but it actually prints out "null" because the initialization is 
overwritten. 

package examples.rules.init;

public class ADI extends ADI_a {  
    private String a = null;  //VIOLATION- The field "a" is also initialized
                      //by the 'init()' method from the superclass' constructor
    public ADI() {
        super();  //VIOLATION
    }   
    public void init() {
         a = "foo";
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ADI ADI_Obj = new ADI();
        System.err.println(ADI_Obj.a);
    }
}

abstract class ADI_a {
    public ADI_a() {
        init();
    }
    abstract void init();
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The best repair in this case is to remove the explicit initialization of the 
field in the declaration.  Explicitly initializing a field in the declaration 
that has already been initialized is likely a bug.

package examples.rules.init;

public class ADIFixed extends ADI_a {
    private String a;  //FIXED- removed the explicit initialization of "a"
    public ADIFixed() {
        super(); 
    }
    public void init() {
         a = "foo";
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ADIFixed ADI_Obj = new ADIFixed();
        System.err.println(ADI_Obj.a);
    }
}

abstract class ADI_a {
    public ADI_a() {
        init();
    }
    abstract void init();
}
