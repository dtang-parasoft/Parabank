DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rules from this category are deprecated - see METRIC category.

Counts the number of lines in a method.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not test "abstract", "native", or any methods that are 
declared in the interface.

Jtest will report an error if the value is greater or equal 100.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Extremely long methods can be difficult to comprehend and often contain several
conceptually unrelated functions.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

We count from the line containing the class' opening "{" brace to the line
containing the class' closing "}" brace.

The following class counts as two lines:

package examples.rules.metrics;

public class TNLM {
    
    public void method() {
	System.out.println("test");
    }
}

// As does this one:
class TNLM2 {

    public void method() {
	System.out.println("test");
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Break the method into several methods that each accomplish a single distinct
function.
