Prevent external processes from blocking on output or error streams [CWE.119.BUSSB]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The exec() method of the java.lang.Runtime class and the related
ProcessBuilder.start() method can be used to invoke external programs. While
running, these programs are represented by a java.lang.Process object. This
process contains an input stream, output stream, and error stream. . . Output
from an external process can exhaust the available buffer reserved for its
output or error stream. . . Consequently, when invoking an external process,
if the process sends any data to its output stream, the output stream must be
emptied. Similarly, if the process sends any data to its error stream,
the error stream must also be emptied." [SEI CERT, FIO07-J]

This rule identifies external processes whose output or error streams are
neither emptied nor redirected.

The rule detects when the following methods are not called on an external
process before the waitFor() method is called:
- getInputStream(), redirectInput(), or redirectOutput()
- getErrorStream(), redirectError(), or redirectErrorStream()

The rule assumes that external processes are processes that are invoked with
one of the following methods:
- the exec() method from the java.lang.Runtime
- the start() method from the java.lang.ProcessBuilder class

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not trigger if the inheritIO() method is called on an external
process.

<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Failure to properly manage the I/O streams of external processes can result
in runtime exceptions and in DoS vulnerabilities." [SEI CERT, FIO07-J]


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you ensure that output or error streams of external processes
are emptied to prevent them from blocking the I/O buffers.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the output and error streams of the external process
invoked with the exec() method are not emptied. 

    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    Process proc = rt.exec("program"); // VIOLATION 
    int exitVal = proc.waitFor();


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by calling the getInputStream() and getErrorStream()
methods.

    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    Process proc = rt.exec("program"); //FIXED
 
    BufferedReader output = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(proc.getInputStream()));
    while ((output.readLine()) != null) {}
  
    BufferedReader errorstream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(proc.getErrorStream()));
    while ((errorstream.readLine()) != null) {}
 

    int exitVal = proc.waitFor();
