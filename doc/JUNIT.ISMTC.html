DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will flag a violation for each JUnit test class which implements
the "static" "suite()" method.  The signature of the "suite()" methods which 
will be flagged by this rule is "static junit.framework.Test suite()".

SINCE

<PRE>

v8.1



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will only test classes which meet one of the following conditions:

1. The class extends "junit.framework.TestCase".
2. The class has at least one method with the "org.junit.Test" annotation.  
This only applies to JUnit 4.0 and later.

There are some cases where implementing a custom "suite()" method is 
necessary.  For instance, when writing test classes in JUnit 4.0 and 
later, you must define a "suite()" method which returns an instance of
"junit.framework.JUnit4TestAdapter" if you plan on running the tests using 
an older version of the JUnit runner.  The rule will not flag this case.

Another situation where it is common to define the "suite()" method is if 
you need to create a test suite which groups together several different 
JUnit test classes.  The rule will also not flag this case.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Implementing the "suite()" method in a JUnit test class is generally not 
necessary.  JUnit will automatically extract the test suite based on the 
names of the test methods or (for JUnit 4.0 and later) the annotations of
the test methods.  The only time you need to implement the "suite()" 
method is when you need it to have some customized behavior; however, 
this situation is rare.  

Implementing the "suite()" method can also lead to bugs.  Doing so means 
that you must remember to add any new test methods to the suite whenever 
you add new test methods.  This is easy to forget.

If "suite()" functionality is needed in JUnit 4.0 or later, then it is
preferred to use the @RunWith and @Suite.SuiteClasses method instead.
See REFERENCES for more information.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.junit;

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class ISMTC extends TestCase {
    public ISMTC(String s) {
        super(s);
    }

    public static Test suite() {  //VIOLATION
        TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(ISMTC.class);
        suite.addTest(new ISMTC("testAdd"));
        return suite;
    }

    public void testAdd() {
        // some test method
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the "suite()" method unless you perform some custom operations in
that method which will not be done automatically by JUnit.

package examples.rules.junit;

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class ISMTCFixed extends TestCase {
    public ISMTCFixed(String s) {
        super(s);
    }

    //FIXED- removed "suite()" method

    public void testAdd() {
        // some test method
    }
}
