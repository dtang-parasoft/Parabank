DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Using a logging mechanism to track caught exceptions allows you to
obtain information about the possible security vulnerabilities and 
appropriately fix code defects. Exceptions that are caught but are
not logged should be rethrown. 
If you want to handle an exception without logging or rethrowing it,
it is a good practice to leave an appropriate comment in your code.

By default, this rule detects 'catch' clauses that do not include
one of the following:
- a call to a logging method
- a 'throw' statement that rethrows the exception

The rule can be parameterized (see PARAMETERS).

SECURITY RELEVANCE

<PRE>

"Exploitation of insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock of nearly
every major incident. Attackers rely on the lack of monitoring and timely
response to achieve their goals without being detected." [OWASP Top 10-2017]

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Acceptable Loggers (Specify fully qualified names)
    -Allows you to specify classes the rule will consider to be loggers.
     A call to a method of a logging class specified here or any of its
     subclasses will be treated as a call to a logger.
    -By default, "java.util.logging.Logger" and "org.apache.log4j.Logger" are
     specified.

-Logging method name in regular expression
    -Allows you to specify custom logging methods. A call to a method specified
     here will be treated as a call to a logger.
    -Use regular expressions to specify the method names. 
    -By default, "^log.*" is specified.  As a result, any method whose name 
     starts with "log" is recognized as a logging method.
 
-Catch clause should contain
    -Logging method - The rule will trigger when the 'catch' block does not
     contain a call to a logger.
    -Logging method or 'throw' exception statement (default) - The rule will
     trigger when the 'catch' block contains neither a call to a logger nor 
     a statement that rethrows the exception.
    -Logging method, comment, or 'throw' exception statement - The rule will
     trigger when the 'catch' block contains neither a call to a logger nor
     a statement that rethrows the exception, and there is  no comment that
     this is expected.
    
-Check if the exception is passed into the logging method call
    -If enabled, the rule will trigger when the logging method that is called
     in the 'catch' block' does not take the caught exception as an argument.
     This allows you to ensure that information about the exception is passed
     to the logging method.
    - This parameter is disabled by default.
     
-Check if the exception passed to the logging method is complete
    -If enabled, the rule will trigger when the exception information passed
     to the logging method is incomplete.
    -This parameter is disabled by default.

-Check if the caught exception is passed to a new exception or rethrown
    -If enabled, the rule will trigger when the caught exception is neither
     rethrown from the 'catch' block nor passed to the new exception that is
     thrown.
    -This parameter is disabled by default.

BENEFITS

This rule helps you ensure that information about caught exceptions is logged,
which improves protection against vulnerabilities and facilitates fixing code
defects.
