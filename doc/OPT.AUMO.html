Avoid unnecessary Map operations [OPT.AUMO]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies unnecessary java.util.Map operations. The following
operations are considered unnecessary:
    1) Call to 'map.containsKey(key)' followed by 'map.get(key)'.
       Instead call 'map.get(key)' and check for a "null" return value.
    2) Call to 'map.get(key)' followed by 'map.remove(key)'.
       Instead use the return value from 'map.remove(key)'.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, optimizations are especially important.

Unnecessary Map operations may lead to the map being searched twice instead of
once. Elimination of unnecessary Map operations can improve performance,
especially if the Map is large.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If a Map is used that can hold "null" values then a "null" return value can mean
two different things:
    1) The key was present but the value was "null"
    2) The key was not present
In some cases it is necessary to know whether a key is present or not.

To catch more cases, this rule does not require the 'get()' to immediately
follow the 'containsKey()' call or the 'remove()' to immediately follow the
'get()' call. In some situations, it may not make sense to refactor or eliminate
one of the Map operations.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.opt;

public class AUMO {
    public void method(Map map, String key) {
        Object value = null;
        if (map.containsKey(key)) { //VIOLATION
            value = map.get(key);
        }

        if (value != null) {
            ...
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the unnecessary operation.

package examples.rules.opt;

public class AUMOFixed {
    public void method(Map map, String key) {
        Object value = map.get(key); //FIXED
        if (value != null) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
