DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This metric counts how many types are used by a given type. A type is used (coupled to)
another type when:
- its field (either instance or static) is accessed
- its method (either instance or static) is called
- its constructor is called

A high number of coupled object classes means types depend on each other too much
and will be hard to reuse. The more independent a type is, the easier it is to reuse
in other applications. In order to improve modularity and promote reuse, coupling 
inter-object types should be kept to a minimum. The more couples, the higher 
the sensitivity to changes in other parts of the design, resulting in more difficult
maintenance.

        import java.util.List;

                f.baz();
                f.bar = 4;
 
+1              q.waldo(3);
 
                list.add(1);
            }
