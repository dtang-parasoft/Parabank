This rule identifies package-private classes that are not as inaccessible as
possible. An error is reported for each occurrence.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule and its Quick Fix may conflict with the rule OPT.ICGA for the case of
inner "package-private" types.  The Quick Fix for this rule may change the
accessibility of an inner type from "package-private" to "private".  This may
cause OPT.ICGA to instruct you to change the inner class back from "private" to
a less restrictive accessibility.

Both rules should not be enabled at the same time.  Which rule should be
followed depends on which is a higher priority: efficiency or limiting
accessibility.  If efficiency is a priority, enable OPT.ICGA.  If limiting
accessibility is more of a priority, enable this rule.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Following this rule makes the code more object-oriented and makes its
dependencies easier to understand.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change the class' accessibility or document the reason for the
excessive accessibility.
