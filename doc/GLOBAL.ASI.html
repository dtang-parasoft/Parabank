DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies methods that do not use any instance class members (i.e.
non-static fields and methods) and are not declared static. An error is
reported for each occurrence.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You should not declare any methods which you intend to override as "static"
since overriding "static" methods is a confusing practice.  The rule tries to
reduce the number of cases it flags where a method is intended to be overridden
by not flagging on "public" and "protected" methods by default and not checking
"abstract" classes by default.  The rule will also never flag on methods which
are actually overridden in your workspace or are overriding some other method.
However, it may still be necessary to suppress some violations of this rule if
you intend for a method to be overridden at some point in the future.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check methods with accessibility:
    -public (Default is "false")
    -protected (Default is "false")
    -package-private (Default is "true")
    -private (Default is "true")
    -By default, only "private" and package-private methods will be checked.
     "public" and "protected" methods are often designed to be overridden, so
     they should not be declared as "static".  Even if the class which overrides
     the "public" or "protected" method is not available when the rule is run,
     it may be your intention to add such a class later.  Also, it is possible
     that the class which overrides this method is not in your workspace.  This
     is why Jtest will not flag these cases with the default parameter settings.
-Ignore method declaration within "abstract" classes (default is false)
 Some methods within an "abstract" class are designed to be overridden by
 an extending class. However, at the time that the "abstract" class is designed,
 an extending class might not be available yet. To preserve the original design,
 method declarations within "abstract" class should not be flagged as candidates
 to declare as "static" in some cases.
 -Ignore "synchronized" method declarations (default is false)
 "static" "synchronized" methods synchronize on the Class object while
 non-"static" "synchronized" methods synchronize on an instance object. So,
 changing the method to "static" may inadvertently change the lock object the
 method synchronizes on.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A method that does not make use of any non-static data can carry out its
intended behavior without creating an instance of the class. Consequently, it
should be declared "static".

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.global;

public class ASI {
    private int add (int i, int j) {  // VIOLATION
        return i + j;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declare the method "static".

package examples.rules.global;

public class ASIFixed {
    private static int method (int i, int j) {  // FIXED
        return i + j;
    }
}
