DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies empty "public" constructors in classes which have no 
other constructors defined.  An empty "public" constructor is the same as 
the default constructor provided by Java for classes with no other 
constructors defined, so it need not be explicitly defined.  A constructor
is considered "empty" if its body contains no statements.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If both CODSTA.DCTOR and this rule are enabled, there may be conflicts 
between the two rules.  The rule CODSTA.DCTOR can be used to enforce the 
opposite of this rule.  That is, CODSTA.DCTOR will make sure that an 
explicit "public" constructor is defined in classes which have no explicit 
constructor (in addition to other things).  It is not recommended that you 
use both rules at the same time.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Since an empty "public" constructor is implicitly defined for all classes
which have no other constructors, explicitly defining such a constructor is
unnecessary.  Removing the definition will help to make the code more 
compact. 


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Some people prefer to explicitly define all constructors to make it more
clear to the reader of the code what constructors are available.  Whether
or not this rule should be followed is a matter of personal preference.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.usc;

public class EPC {
    public EPC() {  //VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the explicitly defined constructor.

package examples.rules.pb.usc;

public class EPCFixed {
    //FIXED- implicitly defined EPCFixed constructor
}
