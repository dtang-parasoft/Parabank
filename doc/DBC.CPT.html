DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that, if there is a postcondition in a method saying that 
"$result != null", there is no "return null;" statement in the method's body.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is incorrect to have a postcondition stating "$result != null" if there is
a "return null;" statement in its body.  Fixing this may avoid a lot of 
confusion.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.dbc;

public class CPT {
    /**
    * @post $result != null
    **/
    public CPT method() {
        return null;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the misleading postcondition, or change it so that it is correct.

package examples.rules.dbc;

public class CPTFixed {
    /**
    * @post $result == null
    **/
    public CPTFixed method() {
        return null;
    }
}
