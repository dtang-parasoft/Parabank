DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies methods that are declared to throw exception types
that are either too generic or are unchecked exceptions.
By default, the rule detects methods which are declared to throw 'Exception',
'Error', 'Throwable', or 'RuntimeException'. You can parameterize the rule
to identify methods that are declared to throw other exception types; see
PARAMETERS.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

<PRE>

"Throwing overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is
more likely to contain security vulnerabilities." [CWE-397]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Exception types which should not be declared to be thrown (fully qualified 
 names)
    -Default values are 'java.lang.Exception', 'java.lang.Error', 'java.lang.
     Throwable', and 'java.lang.RuntimeException'.
-Skip JUnit classes (default is false)
    -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will not analyze methods in JUnit
	 test classes.
-Check for exceptions which are subclasses of 'Error' and 'RuntimeException'. 
 (default is false)
    -If this parameter is enabled, a violation will be flagged for each 
     exception which is declared to be thrown and which is a subclass of 'Error' 
     or 'RuntimeException'.  Exceptions which are a subclass of one of these two
     classes are unchecked exceptions.
-Ignore overriding methods. (default is true)
    -If a method overrides another method, it must be declared to throw the same
     exceptions as the method being overridden. For this reason, overriding
     methods should usually be ignored.
-Ignore methods which propagate exception types of called methods.
 (default is true)
    -If this parameter is enabled, a method throwing a generic exception type
     will be ignored if it calls another method which throws the same exception
     type.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declaring a method to throw too generic of an exception type or an unchecked 
exception is confusing. If a generic exception type, such as 'Exception', is
declared as the thrown exception type, the actual types of the exceptions that
users of the method will need to handle are obscured.  Following this rule
makes code clearer and less error-prone.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.bp;

public class NTX {
    void lostDetailsTest () throws Exception {  // VIOLATION
        try {
            throw new java.io.IOException ("IO exception");
        } finally  {
        }
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not declare a method to throw an exception type which is too generic or an
unchecked exception. Also, always catch exceptions that may occur in the 
"finally" block.

package examples.rules.codsta.bp;

public class NTXFixed {
    void lostDetailsTest () throws java.io.IOException {  // FIXED
        try {
            throw new java.io.IOException ("IO exception");
        } finally  {
        }
    }
}
