BENEFITS

<PRE>

The unary operator '+' can be omitted as any value without the 
unary operator '+' would be implicitly recognized as 
positive. Besides, the unary operator '+' could sometimes 
indicate possible bugs that could not be detected at the
compiler level. For example, value += 1 might accidentally
be written as value =+ 1, which is syntactically correct, 
but has completely different semantics.
