Avoid NullPointerException [CWE.457.NP]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Each variable or expression that is dereferenced should have a non-null value
at the point of dereferencing on any flow path.
A variable or expression is dereferenced in Java in one of the following cases:
   * a method is called on it (a.method());
   * one of its fields is requested (a.field);
   * the length of an array is requested (arr.length);
   * an array element is requested (arr[i]).

This rule detects when a NullPointerException may possibly be thrown at runtime
due to a null pointer dereference.

Violations reported by this rule typically point to paths that dereference
uninitialized variables. Alternatively, they could point to paths related to
missing requirements, unimplemented functionality, or secondary use cases.
Assumptions that are made at the development stage about how the system is
meant to be used or what kind of stimuli it would take need to be included in
the requirements and properly implemented in the system to prevent the system
from being used incorrectly. If a missing implementation and a possible misuse
of the system is detected, the paths will represent the missing requirements
and unimplemented functionality.

"NULL pointer dereferences usually result in the failure of the process unless
exception handling (on some platforms) is available and implemented. Even when
exception handling is used, it can still be very difficult to return
the software to a safe state of operation." [CWE-476]

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

The "Reporting of violations where variable is known to be null due to a null
check" group of parameters allows you to specify how the rule reports null
checks:
   * If disabled, the rule will report violations only on variables that are
     certain to be assigned with a null value.
   * If enabled, the rule will report violations not only for null value
     assignment, but also when a check for a null value that stipulates null
	 pointer dereferencing at the point of use is detected. Here is an example
	 of this type of violations:
	 
        boolean b = (obj == null); // null check stipulates null dereferencing
        ...                        // at violation point
        if (b) {
           ...
           obj.toString(); // violation is reported if this option is enabled
        }

  The "Except for the cases when the null check is performed inside a called
  method of the following visibility" parameter helps you reduce the number of
  unwanted violations caused by a null check. Enabling this option allows you
  to specify which methods the rule ignores during null check, depending on
  their visibility. The following visibility levels are available:
   * "public" 
   * "public, protected"
   * "public, protected, package-private" (default)
   * "methods of any visibility"

  The following table describes the rule behavior for different visibility
  options and parameterization options. Violations are only reported for
  combinations marked with '+'.
	                                                           method visibility
  Parameterization:                                | public | protected | package private | private |
  the option is disabled                           |    +   |     +     |        +        |    +    |
  "public"                                         |    -   |     +     |        +        |    +    |
  "protected and public"                           |    -   |     -     |        +        |    +    |
  "package-private, protected and public"          |    -   |     -     |        -        |    +    |
  "private, package-private, protected and public" |    -   |     -     |        -        |    -    |

  Consider the following example:

     class Example
     {
        protected void foo(Object obj)
        {
           if (obj != null) {
              ...
           }
        }

        void bar(Object obj)
        {
           foo(obj);
           obj.toString(); // is the violation reported?
        }
     }

  Whether the violation inside bar() will be reported or not depends on
  the visibility of foo() and parameterization of the rule. With the default
  parameterization, violations in the bar() function will not be reported
  because foo() is a protected method.

The "Methods that do not accept null as their parameters" parameter allows you
to specify methods whose parameters are not allowed to accept null.

Fill in the following columns to configure a method and specify the data it
affects. 
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the method. If disabled, the rule assumes
    that the method can take null as parameters.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.
- "Non-null parameters" - specifies which method parameters do not accept null.
    List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or use "*" to
	specify that none of the method parameters accept null.


The "Potential null returners" group of parameters allows you to specify if
the potential ability of some methods to return null should be taken into
consideration during analysis. Currently, this feature is implemented for
methods from the standard Java 2 packages java.lang, java.io, java.util.
You can enable one or more of the following options:
   1 "Consider J2SE methods which may return null and it's hard to prevent it"
     Methods that may return null and are difficult to protect from returning
     null. In this case, the code should not assume that the returned value
     will be non-null and perform appropriate checks where necessary.

   2 "Consider J2SE methods which may return null but it's not hard to prevent
     it"
     Methods that may return null but can be written in such a way that they
	 never will return null. In this case, it is not necessary to check
     the returned values.

   3 "Consider J2SE collections' access methods can return null"
     Collections access methods that may return null
     
public class ExtendedNullPointer
{
    String sFileName = "";

    Map&lt;String, Locale&gt; supportedLocalesMap = new HashMap&lt;String, Locale&gt;();

    int getLineLength()
    {
        String sFirstLine = "First line";
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(sFileName));
            sFirstLine = reader.readLine();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception occured. " + e.toString());
            System.out.println("Cause message: " + e.getCause().getMessage()); // VIOLATION (if parameter #1 turned on)
        } finally {
            close(reader);
        }
        return sFirstLine.length(); // VIOLATION (if parameter #2 turned on)
    }

    String getCurrentCountryName()
    {
        String sLanguage = System.getProperty("Language");
        String sLngLowerCase = sLanguage.toLowerCase(); // VIOLATION (if parameter #1 turned on)
        return getCountry(sLngLowerCase, true);
    }

    String getCountry(String languageId, boolean bDisplayName)
    {
        Locale locale = supportedLocalesMap.get(languageId);
        return locale.getCountry(); // VIOLATION (if parameter #3 turned on)
    }

    private void close(Reader reader)
    {
        if (reader == null) {
            return;
        }
        try {
            reader.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {}
    }
}


The "External functions that may return null" parameter allows you to specify
additional methods whose return values will be assumed to be null.

Fill in the following columns to configure a method.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the method. If disabled, the rule does not
    consider the method to be a null-returning method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.

<PRE>

Here is an example that triggers a violation:

public class Example
{
    public void foo(String arg)
    {
        arg.length(); // VIOLATION
    }

    public void goo()
    {
        foo(null);
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code won't trigger a violation because when the argument is null,
the method is never called on it:

public class Repair
{
    public void foo(String arg)
    {
        if (arg != null) {
            arg.length(); // NO VIOLATION
        }
    }

    public void goo()
    {
        foo(null);
    }
}
