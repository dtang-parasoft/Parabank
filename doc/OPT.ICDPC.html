DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks to make sure that an integer type (short, int, or long) is not 
cast to a floating point type (float or double) and passed to the "Math.ceil()" 
method.  This operation is a no-op since converting an integer to a floating 
point should give a number with no fractional part.  A violation will be flagged
for each occurrence.

<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, optimizations are especially important.

Calling "Math.ceil()" with a number that has no fractional part as the argument
is unnecessary and is likely indicative of a bug in the logic of the code.  
Perhaps the argument to "Math.ceil()" was supposed to be something that
