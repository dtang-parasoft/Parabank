DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented
to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When
this occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number."
[CWE-190]

Similarly, an integer underflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is
decremented to a value that is too small to store in the associated
representation. As a result, the value may wrap to become a very large number.

You can prevent overflows and underflows by ensuring that arithmetic operations
yield values that are within the range that can be stored in the associated
representation (i.e. they are not larger than the maximum or lower than
the minimum of the representable value) and by avoiding casts to a smaller
type.

This rule detects when an integer overflow or underflow occurs in integer
arithmetic operations or when integral values are cast to a smaller type.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"While [wraparound] may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on
wrapping, it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is
especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using
user-supplied inputs. This becomes security-critical when the result is used to
control looping, make a security decision, or determine the offset or size in
behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, concatenation, etc." [CWE-190]

"This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to
execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's
implicit security policy." [CWE-191]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

'Aggressive mode' - With this parameter enabled, the rule triggers when
an integer overflow occurs when the integer is being cast to a type that is
at least the same size as the operand type or when the cast value is -1.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By default, the rule does not report an integer overflow if the integer is
cast to a type that is at least the same size as the operand type 
or if the cast value is -1. The rule can be parameterized to enable
reporting of such cases (see PARAMETERS).



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent unintended integer wraparound that can lead to
undefined behavior, memory corruption, or security attacks (see SECURITY
RELEVANCE).

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the sum of variables 'a' and 'b' is returned as int 
type. As a result, an integer overflow occurs, because the value returned 
(4000000000) exceeds the maximum value for a variable of type int (2147483647).

public class Example
{
    int testArithmetic()
    {
        int a = 2000000000;
        int b = 2000000000;
        return a + b; // VIOLATION
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by using a variable of type 'long' that can store the sum
of variables 'a' and 'b'.

public class Repair
{
    long testArithmetic()
    {
        long a = 2000000000;
        long b = 2000000000;
        return a + b; // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
