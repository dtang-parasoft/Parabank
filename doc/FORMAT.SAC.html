DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
    
This rule identifies any comma that is not followed by the required number of space
characters. With the default parameters, an error is reported if a comma is not followed by one
space. An error is reported for excess space as well as for missing space. 

This rule applies to all commas in a source file except for commas in comments 
or literal strings, or commas that appear at the end of a line. Commas that are  
followed by only whitespace or comments on the same line are also considered to
be at the end of a line.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Number of spaces after every comma (default value is 1)
-Commas must not be preceded by a space. (default is false)
    -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will check that commas are not 
     preceded by a space character (in addition to being followed by the 
     specified number of spaces).  Spaces at the beginning or end of lines are
     ignored, so commas will not be flagged if they are the first non-whitespace
     character on a line.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If all team members follow the same formatting style, it will be easier for each
team member to read and understand the code.
