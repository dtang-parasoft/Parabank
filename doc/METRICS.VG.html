DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rules from this category are deprecated - see METRIC category.

Measures the 'cyclomatic complexity' of a method.  Cyclomatic complexity
represents the number of "while", "for", "if" and "switch" statements in a
method.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not test "abstract", "native", and any methods that are
declared in the interface.

Jtest will report an error if the value is greater or equals 30.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Studies have found that methods with cyclomatic complexity higher than 10 are
error-prone.
