DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

Empty blocks should have comments explaining why they were left empty.  This 
rule will flag a violation for any empty block which does not contain a comment
in its body.

PARAMETERS

-Ignore the bodies of non-"public" constructors 
    -Default is "true".
    -It is common practice to provide non-"public" constructors with empty 
     bodies to prevent the class from having a default "public" constructor or 
     to limit which types can construct the class in some other way.  For this
     reason, the rule will not flag on the bodies of non-"public" constructors 
     by default.
-Ignore the bodies of implementations of interface methods
    -Default is "true".
    -Because the methods of all interfaces which are implemented by a class must 
     be implemented, it is common practice to implement these methods with an 
     empty body.  For this reason, the rule will not flag on the bodies of 
     implementations of interface methods by default.
-Ignore the bodies of overriding methods
    -Default is "false".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If an empty block is not commented, it can be unclear whether the block was
intentionally left empty or whether there was supposed to be some code in the
block which was never implemented.  A comment should be added to the block 
explaining why it was left empty.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class CEB {
    int posNum, negNum;

    public CEB()
    {                       // VIOLATION
    }

    public void setField(int i)
    {
        if (i &lt; 0)
        {
            negNum = i;
        }
        else if (i == 0)
        {                   // VIOLATION
            ;
        }
        else
        {
            posNum = i;
        }

Add a comment to the empty block explaining why it is empty.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class CEBFixed {
    int posNum, negNum;
    
    public CEBFixed()
    {                       // FIXED
        // not yet implemented
    }
    
    public void setField(int i)
    {
        if (i &lt; 0)
        {
            negNum = i;
        }
        else if (i == 0)
        {                   // FIXED
            // intentionally left empty- do nothing in case of "0"
        }
        else
        {
            posNum = i;
        }
