DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Methods inherited from the class "Object" should not be declared in an 
interface.  This rule will flag a violation for each method declared in an 
interface which has the same signature as one of the methods inherited by all
classes from class "Object".

BENEFITS

<PRE>

When someone puts the signature of one of the methods declared in class 
"Object" in an interface, he probably means to enforce that all classes 
implementing that interface will provide an implementation of that method other
than the default one inherited from "Object".  However, the compiler will not
enforce this since the method inherited from "Object" will satisfy the 
requirement that the class must implement the method declared in the interface.
In other words, putting a method inherited from "Object" in an interface serves 
no purpose from the programmer's perspective.  Putting the method in an 
interface only creates confusion.

<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Sometimes programmers choose to put methods inherited from "Object" in an 
interface for the purpose of commenting the methods.  For instance, you may want 
to do this to specify some additional contract that a method must satisfy.  If
you choose to follow this coding practice, this rule should not be used.

package examples.rules.oop;

public interface IDOM { 
    String toString();  //VIOLATION
}

class IDOM_b implements IDOM {
}

<PRE>

To enforce that all implementing classes must implement their own custom version 
of some method, you must use either a different name or different parameters 
than the method defined in class "Object".  If this is not the case, you should
remove the method from the interface. 

package examples.rules.oop;

public class IDOMFixed { 
    String toStringSpecial();  //VIOLATION
}

class IDOMFixed_b implements IDOMFixed {
    String toStringSpecial(){
        return super.toString() + " Special";
    }
}
