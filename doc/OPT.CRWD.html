Close resources as early as possible [OPT.CRWD]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects cases where the programmer could possibly improve the efficiency
of code by moving a call to a "close" method on a resource earlier in the method.
The rule checks for complete loops ("for", "while", or "do" loops) between the last
use of an object and the call to "close" on that object. A violation will be reported
for each occurrence. This rule will check all resources in the "java.io.*" package,
the "java.net.*" package, as well as "java.sql.Connection" objects.

SINCE

<PRE>

v8.0



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will not report a violation for any calls to "close" that are nested
within a "finally" block since it is a common practice to close all resources in
a "finally" block.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability
problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak,
the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting
the resource pool.
When a resource containing sensitive information is not correctly shutdown,
it may expose the sensitive data in a subsequent allocation." [CWE-404]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, therefore optimizations are especially
important.

Since loops can take a long time to execute, it is advisable to close all
resources that are not necessary within or after a loop before you enter that loop.
