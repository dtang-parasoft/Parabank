DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The software does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed
authentication attempts within in a short time frame, making it more susceptible
to brute force attacks." [CWE-307]

A brute-force attack is an attempt to crack a password or passphrase using
a trial-and-error approach. By submitting a large number of values within
a short time frame, an attacker may eventually guess correctly and gain access
to the account they target.
To avoid this, ensure that sufficient mechanisms that prevent multiple failed
authentication attempts are implemented in your application's code or on
the server side.
This rule identifies code that should be inspected to verify that such
prevention measures are implemented in Spring applications.

The rule analyzes the workspace and checks for code to inspect in the following
hierarchy:

1. Classes that contain one of the following:
 - an object of the AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent class
 - an implementation of ApplicationListener&lt;AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent&gt;
   that provides custom onApplicationEvent.

2. If none of the above is found in the code, the rule checks for implementations
   of the org.springframework.security.web.authentication.AuthenticationFailureHandler
   interface that has a custom implementation of the onAuthenticationFailure method.

3. If none of the above is found in the code, the rule checks for classes that
   implement the 'configure()' method with a parameter of org.springframework.security
   type.

4. If none of the above is found in the code, the rule checks for classes with
   the 'public static void main()' method that contains one of the following:
 - an invocation of 'run()' method from the org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication
   class
 - creation of a subclass of AbstractApplicationContext  

Once you verify that your code ensures sufficient prevention against multiple
authentication attempts, can suppress the finding to prevent it from being
reported in the subsequent analysis runs.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An attacker could perform an arbitrary number of authentication attempts using
different passwords, and eventually gain access to the targeted account."
[CWE-307]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you ensure that your Spring application is protected against
brute-force attacks.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the 'AuthenticationFailureEventListener' class uses
an object of the 'AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent' class.

@Component
public class AuthenticationFailureEventListener implements ApplicationListener&lt;AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent&gt; { // VIOLATION

    public void onApplicationEvent( AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent e) {
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Verify that an appropriate mechanism that prevents multiple failed
authentication attempts is implemented in your application or on the server
and then suppress the violation to prevent it from being reported in
the subsequent analysis runs.
