DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies methods that call only the overridden implementation
(superclass implementation). An error is reported for each method declaration
that 1) overrides its superclass' method and 2) has a method declaration body
that calls only its superclass' implementation. Constructors are not
reported as errors. Errors are not reported for method declarations 
that change the accessibility of the overridden method.

The rule will also flag a violation for methods which override another method
but have the exact same implementation as the overridden method.  For purposes
of this rule, an implementation is considered exactly the same as the overridden
implementation if the text of the method bodies is the same (ignoring any 
spaces, comments, and empty statements).

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The methods identified by this rule are not performing a useful purpose.
By removing these methods, you make code simpler, easier to read, and less error prone.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public class SO {
    public boolean equals (Object obj) { //VIOLATION
        return super.equals(obj);
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the 'equals()' method.

package examples.rules.uc;

public class SOFixed {
    //FIXED (the method is removed since it's not needed)
}
