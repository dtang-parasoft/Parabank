DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies unused private methods. An error is reported
for each occurrence.

CLASS

SINCE

v4.5



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule will ignore methods with the following signatures which are declared
within classes that implement "java.io.Serializable":

private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out);
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in);
private Object writeReplace();
private Object readResolve();

These methods are designed to be called implicitly by the serialization and
deserialization mechanisms, so they need not be called directly from your code.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Weak Security Controls
category: Code Quality

The code may implement features that bypass security.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore methods with names (in regular expression)
    -Allows you to provide a list of methods to ignore. If a method's name 
     matches any of the regular expressions, it will be exempt from this rule.
     For example, if "^writeObject$" is added to the list, then a method with 
     name "writeObject" would not be identified as a rule violation-- even if it 
     is an unused "private" method
    -The list is empty by default.  You should customize the list by adding the
     names of any methods that you don't want to check. 
-Ignore methods which are used within a Jcontract tag
    -Default is "false".
    -Sometimes, "private" methods which are not called from within the code are
     still necessary because they are called from a Jcontract Javadoc tag.  If 
     you use Jcontract and do not want such methods to be flagged as violations,
     you should enable this parameter.  
    -This parameter is disabled by default because it is unusual to have a 
     "private" method which is only called from within the body of a Jcontract
     Javadoc tag.
-Ignore methods preceded by annotations with qualified names
    -Default is "javafx.fxml.FXML"
    -Allows you to ignore methods that are preceded by specific annotations
    -You should customize the list with fully-qualified annotation names

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An unused method could indicate a logical flaw in the corresponding
class, or it could be leftover from a previously deleted section of the
class. 



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public class PM {
    private void unusedMethod () {}  // VIOLATION
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the logical flaw or the leftover method.

package examples.rules.uc;

public class PMFixed {
      // FIXED
}
