DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies mutable classes that do not have initializer flags at the
end of their constructors.  It can also identify initializer flags that are not
volatile.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.0

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A mutable class is one in which an object can be changed once it is created.  
Malicious subclasses that override the Object.finalize method can resurrect 
objects even if an exception was thrown from the constructor. Low-level classes 
with constructors explicitly throwing a java.security.SecurityException are 
likely to have security issues.  Putting a flag at the end of the constructor 
allows the user to check whether a given instance has been fully initialized, 
before any operations with that instance are completed.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If an instance was only partially initialized, it should not be able to be used or
operated on.  Errors can be created which could expose secure data.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Regular expression matching initializer flags(default ".*init.*")
-Ensure flag is volatile (default on)


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Refer to security relevance section.

package examples.rules.security.wsc;

public class INIVF {
    private  boolean initialized;
    
    public INIVF(){   
        this.initialized = true; //VIOLATION
    } 
    
    public INIVF(int num){ }//VIOLATION
}

    private volatile boolean initialized;
    
    public INIVFFixed(){   
        this.initialized = true; //FIXED
    } 
    
    public INIVFFixed(int num){ 
        this.initialized = true; //FIXED
