DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Some Javadoc tags usually are not intended to span more than one line; for instance,
"@author" and "@since" tags usually should have values that are completely 
contained within one line.  This rule will report a violation for each Javadoc 
tag which matches one of the tag types specified in the parameter list and which
spans more than one line.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Tags Which Should Not Span Multiple Lines
    -These are the tag types which will be checked by this rule.
    -By default, only "@author" and "@since" are in this list.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

When certain tags span multiple lines, it can indicate a mistake in the Javadoc.
For instance, it can indicate a missing "@" sign in a subsequent tag or some
Javadoc header text which was supposed to go before the tags but was accidentally
placed after the tags.

<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Even for the tags which are checked by default, there are some cases where tags 
need to span multiple lines.  For instance, "@author" tags may span several lines
for files which have many authors.  If a Javadoc tag intentionally spans multiple
lines, you should suppress the violation.  If the rule is flagging a lot of false
positives for a certain tag type, you can also remove this tag type from the 
parameter list.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For the method "testMethod()", the author will be "Steve This is a test." since
the Javadoc tag is taken to extend to the end of the comment unless another tag
is encountered.  This is clearly not what was intended.  For "testMethod(int)", 
the "@" sign in the "@param" tag was forgotten.

package examples.rules.javadoc;

public class TSOL {
    /**
     * @author Steve    //VIOLATION
     * This is a test.
     */
    public void testMethod() {    
    }
    
    /**
     * @author Steve   //VIOLATION
     * param i
     */
    public void testMethod(int i) {
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Make sure that the tag which spans multiple lines does not indicate a problem with
the Javadoc comment.  In this case, move the Javadoc header text to the beginning 
of the Javadoc comment for the first violation and add the forgotten "@" sign for 
the second violation.

package examples.rules.javadoc;

public class TSOLFixed {
    /**
     * This is a test.  //FIXED
     * @author Steve
     */
    public void testMethod() {    
    }
 
    /**
     * @author Steve
     * @param i       //FIXED
     */
    public void testMethod(int i) {
    }
}
