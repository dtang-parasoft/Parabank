DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In classes that implement custom serialization ("java.io.Serializable"), all 
non-transient, non-static, and non-final fields should be handled by 
the 'readObject' and 'writeObject' methods to ensure that serialization is
complete. All such fields should be assigned in the 'readObject' method and
written out in the 'writeObject' method.

This rule detects when:
- the 'readObject' method fails to include at least one read access to each
non-transient, non-static, and non-final field 
- the 'writeObject' method fails to include at least one write access to each
non-transient, non-static, and non-final field 

This rule assumes that read access involves passing the field as an argument
of a method.

By default, the rule checks the 'readObject' and 'writeObject' methods, but
it can be parameterized to exclude one of the methods from analysis,
see PARAMETERS.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"[D]eserialized data or code can often be modified without using the provided
accessor functions if it does not use cryptography to protect itself.
Furthermore, any cryptography would still be client-side security -- which is
a dangerous security assumption. Data that is untrusted can not be trusted
to be well-formed." [CWE-502]

"The impact of deserialization flaws cannot be overstated. These flaws can lead
to remote code execution attacks, one of the most serious attacks possible."
[OWASP Top 10-2017, A8]

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Maximum level of checking allowed - allows you to specify the number of nested methods
   the rule will analyze when checking for the read and write access. The default depth is 5.
-Check 'writeObject' method - if enabled, the rule analyzes the 'writeObject' method (enabled by default)
-Check 'readObject' method - if enabled, the rule analyzes the 'readObject' method (enabled by default)



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you ensure proper and secure serialization.
