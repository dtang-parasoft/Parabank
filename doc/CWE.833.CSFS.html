DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies "synchronized" methods that call other "synchronized" methods.
An error is reported for each occurrence.

This rule helps prevent potential deadlock conditions which can cause denial of
service. See BENEFITS for more information.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If a "synchronized" method calls another "synchronized" method, it means that
the threads executing this code will try to get a lock on a monitor while
already holding a lock on a different monitor.  This kind of situation can
easily lead to circular dependencies and deadlocks, and should thus be avoided
if possible.  Having a thread holding only a monitor at a time greatly reduces
the chances of getting into deadlocks.

Note:  If both methods synchronize on the same object or class, then no
deadlock will occur.  This rule will not flag any violations for cases like 
this.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Some algorithms depend on locking objects in a specific order.  Use extra caution
when doing this to ensure that the ordering is maintained by all methods trying to
lock multiple objects.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.trs;

public class CSFS {
    public synchronized void method1() {
        CSFS myCSFS= new CSFS();
        myCSFS.method2();
    }
    public synchronized void method2() {
        //deadlock prone
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Try to write the code so that a thread doesn't try to get a lock on a monitor
while already holding a lock.  One possibility is to use a "synchronized"
statement to only synchronize the part of the method that really needs to be
synchronized.  Alternatively, before locking a second object, ensure that it
is not already locked.
