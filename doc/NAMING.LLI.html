DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The names of types, methods, fields, parameters, and variables should be
of a reasonable length. This means that they should be neither too long nor
too short. By default, this rule will flag a violation for any name of a
type, method, field, parameter, or variable that is either longer than the
maximum allowed length or shorter than the minimum allowed length.  The default
maximum allowed length is 30 characters, and the default minimum allowed length
is 3 characters (1 for loop indices).

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The previous rule NAMING.LCIN has been merged into this rule.
This rule will ignore loop index variables by default since it is common to use
short names such as "i", "j", and "k" for loop index variables.  The rule will
also ignore overriding methods since users cannot change the names of overriding
methods without also changing the name of the method that is overridden.

    -Maximum length (Default is 30)
    -Ignore the following names:***

-Method
    -Check method names (Default is "true")
    -Minimum length (Default is 3)
    -Maximum length (Default is 30)
    -Ignore the following names:***

-Field
    -Check field names (Default is "true")
    -Minimum length (Default is 2)
    -Maximum length (Default is 30)
    -Ignore the following names:***

-Parameter
    -Check parameter names (Default is "true")
    -Minimum length (Default is 2)
    -Maximum length (Default is 30)
    -Ignore the following names:***

-Variable
    -Check variable names (Default is "true")
    -Minimum length (Default is 1)
    -Maximum length (Default is 30)
    -Check loop indices
        -Minimum length (Default is 1)
    -Ignore the following names:***

*** Ignore the following names:
    -Identifiers in these lists will be ignored if they are used even if they
    fall outside the acceptable range of lengths.
    -If you have either short or long identifiers that you commonly use as 
     names, you should add them to this list to prevent the rule from flagging
     too many violations.
    -By default, the list is empty.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Names which are too short (fewer than 3 characters by default) are probably not
descriptive enough.  On the other hand, names which are too long (more than 30 
characters by default) can make the code difficult to read.  These names may be 
overly descriptive.  Using names which have lengths between the minimum and 
maximum allowed values will help ensure that names are long enough to be 
descriptive without being excessively long.  Using good names (ones that are
neither too long nor too short) can serve as a form of documentation for code.  
Good names will make the code easier to understand.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The example shown below contains 3 names which are shorter than the minimum 
required length and one name which is longer than the maximum length.  The names
which are too short do not give a proper indication of what the code does.  The
name which is too long is overly verbose.

package examples.rules.naming;

public class LLI {
    String _n;  //VIOLATION
    
    public void methodWhichPrintsOutTheNameToTheUser() {  //VIOLATION - 36 character name
        System.out.println(_n);
    }
    
    public void s(String nn) {  //2 VIOLATIONS
        _n = nn;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use names which are long enough to be descriptive without being excessively
verbose.  Notice that it is much easier to understand the purpose of the field,
methods, and parameter in the repaired code.

package examples.rules.naming;

public class LLI_Fixed {
    String _name;  //FIXED
    
    public void printName() {  //FIXED
        System.out.println(_name);
    }
    
    public void setName(String newName) {  //FIXED
        _name = newName;
    }
}
