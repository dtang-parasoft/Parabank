DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule can be used to enforce package isolation policies. It can control
restrictions on class and package imports into particular packages and their
sub-packages. For example, it is common policy to disallow use of classes
from 'java.lang.reflect' package.  It can be also used to enforce package
isolation policies and prevent architectural dependencies. For example, 
common or core packages should not have dependencies for domain-specific
or specialized packages, while the reverse relation may usually be allowed
where specialized package uses classes from core packages. Package isolation
policy restrictions specified for a package are also active for all
sub-packages, and are applied in the top-down manner. This means that
general restrictions specified on top-level packages can be further
specialized by further restricting or relaxing the isolation policy on 
sub-package levels.  For example, it is possible to forbid imports from
'java.lang.reflect' for all packages, and only allow it in one sub-package,
thus imposing better control over use of Java reflection features.
Regular expressions can be used to specify range of allowed or disallowed
packages on any level of package hierarchy.

v9.1



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
There is a related rule CODSTA.ORG.DINT, however it examines all function
calls.  Therefore, this CODSTA.ORG.IMP rule is much faster than CODSTA.ORG.DINT.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Appropriate configuration of allowed and disallowed packages should be 
specified in rule parameters before the rule can be used.

Table "List of import restrictions" has three columns:
- "Allow" column
For package in the second column, the check box determines whether imports
matching regular expression in third column are allowed (check box enabled)
or disallowed (check box disabled).

- "Package" column
Name of the package in which this rule will be applied.  Package name can be
repeated in multiple rows, if multiple patterns of (dis)allowed packages are
to be specified for the same package.

- "Import declaration fully qualified name (RegExp)" column
Regular expression to be matched against arguments of the import statements
in .java files of the Package.

To prevent noise, if a package, or any of its direct or indirect parent packages
is not listed in the Package column, the rule does not report any violations
for such package.




</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps enforcing on source code level architectural composition
of applications into layers and modules, and control and prevent unwanted
dependencies between modules.  With appropriate parameters this rule increases
maintainability and security of applications.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For the following three classes:

A) TestClass1 in x.y package:

package x.y;

import java.io.Reader;
import java.io.StringReader;
import java.util.Date;

public class TestClass1 {
  public Reader test() {
    Date date = new Date();
    return new StringReader("Example string date: "+date.toString());
  }
}

B) TestClass2 in x.y.z package:

package x.y.z;

import java.io.Reader;
import java.io.StringReader;
import java.util.Date;

public class TestClass2 {
  public Reader test() {
    Date date = new Date();
    return new StringReader("Example string date: "+date.toString());
  }
}

C) TestClass3 in x.y.q package:

package x.y.q;

import java.io.Reader;
import java.io.StringReader;
import java.util.Date;

public class TestClass3 {
  public Reader test() {
    Date date = new Date();
    return new StringReader("Example string date: "+date.toString());
  }
}

and for the following row entered in rule parameters
      Allow | Package |  Import
    checked |  x.y.z  | java.io.*
which allow importing of java.io.* for x.y.z package only, this rule will report
one violation for class TestClass2 related to import of java.util.Date.
(As mentioned in PARAMETERS section, by default all imports for packages which
start from x.y.z are disallowed and must be allowed explicitly)


The following rule parameters
      Allow | Package |  Import
    checked |  x.y    | java.io.*
    checked |  x.y.q  | java.date.*
the rule reports two violations for classes TestClass1 and TestClass2, related to
import of java.util.Date;

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Remove the disallowed imports or review package isolation policy and modify
the rule parameters accordingly.
