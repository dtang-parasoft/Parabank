DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This metric measures the ordinal distance from the class to the root 
of the inheritance tree according to the following rules:
- Classes that have no base type in source code have an inheritance depth 
  of class (IDOC) of 1 (these classes implicitly inherit from Object)
- All other classes have a depth of 1 plus the depth of their super class
- Binary or system/framework types are not counted except Object type, 
  are not counted
- Nothing is reported for interfaces

This metric primarily evaluates reuse, but it also relates to understandability
and testability. The depth of a class within the inheritance hierarchy is 
the maximum length from the class node to the root of the tree and is measured
by the number of ancestor classes. The deeper a class is in the hierarchy,
the greater the number of methods and state variables it is likely to inherit,
which makes predicting its behavior difficult. If the majority of IDOC values
are below 2, it may mean that the code is not taking full advantage
of Object Oriented design and inheritance.
Conversely, industry standards recommend a maximum IDOC value of 5 because
deeper trees constitute greater design complexity as more methods and classes
are involved. Although it can be difficult to understand a system with many
inheritance layers, there is greater potential for reusing tested inherited methods.
