DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies unnecessary parentheses in statements. An error
is reported for any unnecessary parentheses which do not add to
the program's semantic meaning.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Some parentheses that might appear to be semantically unnecessary could enhance
code readability and hence should be preserved. Parentheses might be
placed purposefully in nested operation statements or inline conditional
statements, as those statements could be difficult to read without them.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check inline conditional expressions (default is false)
    By default, the rule will ignore those parentheses and will not flag them as
    errors. However, you can have them identified as errors by enabling the
    above option.

-Check nested operations (default is true)
    By default, the rule will check for unneccesary parentheses in compound 
    expressions nested operations.  However, this can be turned off by
    disabling the above option.

-Check order of operation in expressions (default is false)
    By default, the rule will not remove extra parentheses used for the sake of
    clarifying order of operations.  However, you can have unnecessary
    parentheses (whose removal will not affect the order of operation) be 
    identified as errors by enabling the above option.

-Scope of checking
    -only return statements
    -all statements (default option)
        Because this rule is an extension of a previous implementation that
        only checked for return statements, the 'check only return statement' 
        option is available so that this rule can behave similarly to the 
        previous implementation. Currently, this option is disabled by default.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Sometimes extra parentheses only make the expressions look more complicated.
Removing those parentheses simplifies code, which makes it easier to understand
and less error-prone.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

public class UPOR {
    public Integer getPositiveInteger(Integer i) {
        if ((i.intValue())&lt; 0) //NO FLAG (would be flag if 'check nested operations' is enabled)
            return (null); //VIOLATION
        else {
            i= (i+ 2); //VIOLATION
            return (new Integer(i)); //VIOLATION
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the unnecessary parentheses.

public class UPORFixed {
    public Integer getPositiveInteger(Integer i) {
        if (i.intValue()&lt; 0) //NO FLAG
            return null; //FIXED
        else {
            i= i+ 2; //FIXED
            return new Integer(i); //FIXED
        }
    }
}
