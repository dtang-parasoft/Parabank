DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Passing constant values into a database connection method is a security risk.  
These constant values can include the username, password, and URL for accessing
the database.  Instead of using constant Strings to connect to a database, the 
programmer should get database connection Strings from a secure source.  By 
default, this rule will check the following things:
   1. this rule will look for any calls to the "getConnection()" method of 
      "java.sql.DriverManager" where all the arguments are constant Strings.
   2. this rule will check for the password is hard-coded or not when calling 
      the "getConnection()" method of "java.sql.DriverManager".
   3. this rule will check indirect calls to "getConnection()".

category: Weak Security Controls
category: Data Security

If constant database connection Strings are found in a method, they probably 
were accidentally left in the code.  They should be taken out of all production 
code because leaving these Strings in the code can grant unauthorized users 
access to data. 

This rule helps to enforce the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard) Requirement #6: "Develop and maintain secure systems and 
applications".  Specifically, this rule helps to test for Issue 6.3.6: 
"Removal of custom application accounts, user IDs, and passwords before 
applications become active or are released to customers".

This rule also helps to enforce the PCI DSS Requirement #8: "Assign a unique ID 
to each person with computer access".  Specifically, this rule helps to test for 
Issue 8.5.8: "Do not use group, shared, or generic accounts and passwords".

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Additional Database Connection Methods (in form of &lt;qualified name of declaring 
 type&gt;#&lt;method name&gt;)
    -Methods should be added to this list if their source code is not available,
     if they use a method other than "java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection()" to
     connect to the database, or if they call "DriverManager.getConnection()" 
     indirectly at a nested method call level greater than one.
    -Default value is an empty list.
    -Example: To add the method "dbConnect()" in the class "HCCS" and the
     package "examples.rules.security.wsc" to this list, you would enter 
     "examples.rules.security.wsc.HCCS#dbConnect".

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.security.wsc;

public class HCCS {
    public void method() {
        DB db = new DB();
        Connection conn = db.dbConnect("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/test",
            "scott", "tiger");                                       //VIOLATION
    }
    
    class DB {
        public DB() {
        }
        
        public Connection dbConnect(String db_connect_string, String db_userid,
            String db_password) {
            try {                
                Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
                    db_connect_string, db_userid, db_password);             
                System.out.println("connected");
                return conn;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
                return null;
            }
        }
    };

Instead of passing constant String values into the database connection method,
get the required Strings from a secure source.  You may need to query the user
for this information.
