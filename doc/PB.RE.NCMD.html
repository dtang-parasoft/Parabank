DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A common pattern to prevent NullPointerExceptions is to make sure that some 
field or variable is not "null" and then to dereference it.  The code for this
looks something like this:

if(s != null &amp;&amp; s.equals("foo")) {
    //Do something.
}

Here, "s" is first tested to make sure that it is not "null" before it is 
dereferenced.  A common mistake when using this pattern is for the variable 
being checked for "null" on the left side of the expression to not match the
variable which is dereferenced on the right side of the expression.  For 
example:

if(s != null &amp;&amp; s2.equals("foo")) {
    //Do something.
}

The intention here was to prevent NullPointerExceptions by checking to make sure 
that "s" is not "null" before calling the 'equals()' method on "s"; however, 
the wrong variable was used as the calling object for the 'equals()' method.

This rule will flag a violation for each expression using the "&amp;&amp;" operator 
where a variable (or field) is checked to make sure that it is not "null" on the
left side and a different variable is dereferenced on the right side.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will only flag cases where the variable being dereferenced in the 
condition and the variable being checked against "null" are of the same type.
This helps to cut down on noise.  Code where the types of the variables are the
same is more likely to be a bug because, in these cases, the two variables can 
be used interchangeably.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will help to prevent NullPointerExceptions, which can result in 
sensitive information being leaked to the user.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Bugs like the one described in the "DESCRIPTION" section are common, especially 
when copying and pasting code.  Code which violates this rule should be reviewed 
to make sure it is correct.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The code shown below will throw a "NullPointerException" because the variable
being dereferenced ("s2") does not match the variable which is compared against
"null" ("s").

package examples.rules.pb.re;

public class NCMD {
    public static void method(String s) {
        String s2 = null;
        if(s != null &amp;&amp; s2.equals("")) {  //VIOLATION- should be dereferencing "s" and not "s2"
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        method("");
    } 
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change either the variable that is compared against "null" or the variable that
is dereferenced so that the two match.

package examples.rules.pb.re;

public class NCMD_Fixed {
    public static void method(String s) {
        String s2 = null;
        if(s != null &amp;&amp; s.equals("")) {  //FIXED
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        method("");
    }  
}
