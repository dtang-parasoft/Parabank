The Export-Package manifest attribute in an Eclipse plug-in specifies which packages of code are
accessible at runtime from other plug-ins.

Eclipse 3.0 does not recognize the plugin manifest attribute Export-Package which was introduced in
Eclipse 3.1.  Instead, it uses the Provide-Package manifest attribute.  Eclipse 3.1 and later will
use information from Export-Package even when the same MANIFEST.MF file also contains
Provide-Package.  When supporting both Eclipse 3.0 and 3.1 with the same plug-in, it is important
to make sure that both sections of the manifest file are present and in sync with each other.

Packages that are internal only to the containing plug-in will be marked with a ";x-internal:=true"
suffix in the Export-Package section.  They do not need to be included in the Provide-Package
section.  Packages that are accessed only by a select few other plug-ins will be marked with a
";x-friends:=..." suffix.  Those packages need to be included in the older Provide-Package section.
 Provide-Package does not support the concept of friends, so those packages will be accessible by
all plug-ins under Eclipse 3.0.
