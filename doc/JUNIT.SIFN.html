DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Non-primitive fields of a JUnit test class that are initialized in
a method that sets up the initial state for all test methods should
be set to 'null' in the corresponding method that performs the cleanup.

This rule detects the following cases:
- In JUnit 3, a field of a test class initialized to a non-null value in
  the setUp() method is not set to 'null' in the tearDown() method.
- In JUnit 4, a field of a test class initialized to a non-null value in
  a method annotated with @Before is not set to 'null' in a method annotated
  with @After.
- In JUnit 5, a field of a test class initialized to a non-null value in
  a method annotated with @BeforeEach is not set to 'null' in a method
  annotated with @AfterEach.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that test classes are classes that meet the following
conditions:
- In JUnit 3, a test class is a class that extends the junit.framework.TestCase
  class.
- In JUnit 4, a test class is a class that contains a method marked with
  the @Test annotation.
- In JUnit 5, a test class is a class that contains a method marked with
  one of the following annotations: @Test, @TestFactory, @TestTemplate,
  @ParameterizedTest, @RepeatedTest

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Maximum depth of checking allowed (default is 5)
    -Note that the 'setUp()' or 'tearDown()' methods could call other methods 
     which, in turn, might call other methods and so on.  This parameter 
     specifies the maximum depth of nested method calls which will be inspected 
     to see which fields are initialized in the 'setUp()' method and which 
     fields are set to "null" in the 'tearDown()' method.
    -The default value is '5'.  False positives are generally unlikely when the 
     level is set at '5', but you should increase this level if you are getting
     false positives because the default depth is not enough.  
    -Increasing the value of this parameter may cut down on the number of false
     positives reported by this rule, but it will also increase the computation
     time.  You should only increase the value if you are getting false 
     positives.

package examples.rules.junit;

import junit.framework.*;

public class SIFN extends TestCase {
    private byte [] _array;

    public SIFN(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    }
    
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();
        _array = new byte [100000000];  //VIOLATION- The field "_array" is 
                                        //initialized here but is never set to
                                        //"null" in the "tearDown()" method.
    }
    
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {

REPAIR

<PRE>

Set the field which is initialized in the 'setUp()' method to "null" in the
'tearDown()' method.

package examples.rules.junit;

import junit.framework.*;

public class SIFNFixed extends TestCase {
    private byte [] _array;

    public SIFNFixed(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
    
    public void test01() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println(getName());
    }
    
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();
        _array = new byte [100000000];  
    }
    
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        super.tearDown();
        _array = null;  //FIXED
