Close all "java.io.Closeable" resources in a "finally" block [CERT.FIO04.CCR]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Resources which have a type that implements "java.io.Closeable" should always be
closed. Local "java.io.Closeable" resources should be opened in a "try" block
and closed in a corresponding "finally" block. If a local "java.io.Closeable"
resource is not closed in a "finally" block, there is no guarantee that the resource
will be closed if there is an exception. An error is reported if a created 
"java.io.Closeable" is not closed in a "finally" block (or there is no corresponding
"finally" block).

This rule will not report a violation for fields or for local variables that
another field depends on. Closing a field or a local variable that another field
depends on is likely to break the code, as other methods will depend on these
open resources.

<STRONG>
DEPRECATED
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is deprecated and has been replaced by BD.RES.LEAKS.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will not detect unused resource objects.

This rule is similar to OPT.CIO and several other rules that concern closing
resources. Before JDK 1.5, the "Closeable" interface did not exist, so there
was no general rule to ensure that all "Closeable" resources are closed in
a "finally" block.
The OPT.CIO rule is still included for customers who are not using JDK 1.5 or later,
whereas this rule (OPT.CCR) benefits users of JDK 1.5 or later. As an additional
advantage, it checks all types that implement "java.io.Closeable" (including
user-defined types) instead of just a few I/O resource types.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignored types (Specify fully qualified names)
   -The rule will not report any errors for the types specified on the following list.
   -The default listed types are:
       -java.io.ByteArrayInputStream
       -java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
       -java.io.CharArrayWriter
       -java.io.StringBufferInputStream
       -java.io.StringReader
       -java.io.StringWriter
    
    Objects of these types are not checked because it is guaranteed by the Javadoc
    that the "close()" method for all these classes except "java.io.StringReader"
    will have no effect. Although it is not specified by the Javadoc for
    "java.io.StringReader", failure to close a StringReader object also will not 
    cause a resource leak.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, therefore optimizations are especially
important.

If close() is not called to release all local resources before the method returns,
it may cause a resource leak.

Ensure that your code is structured to close and release all "java.io.Closeable"
resources in all cases-- even in exception and error conditions. When the close
statement is included in a finally block, the resource will always be closed.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.opt;

public class CCR {
    public void method(java.io.File f) {
        java.io.FileInputStream fis = null;
        try {
            fis = new java.io.FileInputStream(f);
            fis.read();
            fis.close();
        } catch (java.io.FileNotFoundException e1) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        } catch (java.io.IOException e2) {
            System.out.println("I/O Exception");
        }
        // VIOLATION: "finally" block with the statement 'fis.close()' is
        // missing
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Ensure that all "java.io.Closeable" resources are closed regardless of any
exceptions which may be thrown if failure to close these resources may result
in a memory leak. 
If there already is a "try" block where the resources are being used, add
a "finally" block after the last "catch" that closes all open "java.io.Closeable"
resources.

If the "java.io.Closeable" resource is not used in a "try" block, consider putting
the code that uses that resource into a "try" block if there is any possibility that
this code will throw an exception. As a result, the resource will be closed in
a "finally" block which will be executed regardless of whether or not an exception
is thrown.

package examples.rules.opt;

public class CCRFixed {
    public void method(java.io.File f) {
        java.io.FileInputStream fis = null;
        try {
            fis = new java.io.FileInputStream(f);
            fis.read();
        } catch (java.io.FileNotFoundException e1) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        } catch (java.io.IOException e2) {
            System.out.println("I/O Exception");
        } finally {
            if (fis != null) {
                try {
                    fis.close();  //FIXED
                } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
                    System.out.println("I/O Exception");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
