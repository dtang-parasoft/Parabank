DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

Introduced by Thomas McCabe, cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly
independent paths through which messages can pass. The result of this measurement
is a single ordinal number that can be used to compare the cyclomatic complexity
across programs. A program module's complexity can also be interpreted as the cost of
producing test cases for the code.

Methods with low cyclomatic complexity imply that decisions are deferred through
message passing--though this does not imply that a method is not complex or intricate.
Methods with a high complexity tend to be more difficult to understand, maintain,
and test; thus complex methods adversely affect an application's reliability.

This metric measures the Essential Cyclomatic Complexity.

The metric is computed by counting the number of unstructured decisions in the flow graph
and incrementing the number be one, as in the following formula:

ECC = Number of unstructured decisions + 1

For this metric, each occurrence of the following expressions is assumed to be
a decision point:
- if, for, while, do-while, case
- conditional expression a?b:c inside if, for, while, do-while condition
- logical operator &amp;&amp; and || inside if, for, while, do-while condition

Unstructured decisions are conditional jumps into or out of other decisions,
for example:
- goto inside if, which is inside switch
- return inside while, which is inside for
Decisions that contain unstructured decisions are also considered to be unstructured.

A high number of decisions makes code difficult to understand and maintain.
