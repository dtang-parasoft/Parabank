DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that the user avoids instantiating an object of a type which 
only has static methods and fields.  A violation is flagged for each such 
instantiation.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule will look for non-static methods in the class being instantiated as 
well as all the other classes and interfaces above it in its hierarchy 
(excluding class "Object").  If a non-static method or field is found in any 
superclass or implemented interface, a violation will not be flagged for this 
rule.

There are some exceptions to this rule as well.  It may be necessary to call the
constructor of a type which has only static fields and methods if the 
constructor does something important, such as setting a member variable.  If 
possible, it would be better to move the actions performed by the constructor 
into a static method in this case.  If this is not possible, the violation 
should be suppressed.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, optimizations are especially important.

There is no need to instantiate an object which only contains static methods and
fields since these methods and fields can be accessed directly using the name
of the class.  Instantiating one of these objects is inefficient.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.opt;

class ISC{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        A foo= new A();  //VIOLATION
        foo.meth();
    }
}

class A{
    static int foo;
    static void meth(){
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not instantiate an object of a type that contains only static methods and
fields.  If you need to access these fields and/or methods, do so directly using 
the name of the class.

package examples.rules.opt;

class ISCFixed{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        A.meth();  //FIXED
    }
}

class A{
    static int foo;
    static void meth(){
    }
}
