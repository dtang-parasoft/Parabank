Do not call the "start" method of threads from inside a constructor [CERT.TSM02.CSTART]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code where 'start()' is invoked inside 
the constructors of classes that extend 'java.lang.Thread'. An 
error is reported for each occurrence.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check the following constructors:
    -Check only classes extending Thread (default true)
    -Check all classes
        -When this option is enabled, a violation will be flagged for each
        'start()' invocation of a thread which is an inner type. By starting
        an inner type thread in a constructor, a "this" reference escapes and
        the thread may be able to view an incompletely constructed object.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If a class has its 'start()' method invoked inside its constructor,
it might imply that the developer might simply want to have
the thread started whenever the constructor is invoked. However,
if such a class has any inherited classes, those inherited classes
would actually start this class's thread before the execution
of their own constructors.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.trs;

public class CSTART extends java.lang.Thread{
    CSTART() {
        //initialization
        start(); //VIOLATION    
    }
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Thread is started");        
        //some computation
    } 
}

package examples.rules.trs;

public class CSTARTFixed extends java.lang.Thread {
    CSTARTFixed() {
        //initialization
        //FIXED: start() invocation is removed, start() should
        //       be called by the caller of the constructor 
        //       instead.
    }
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Thread is started");        
        //some computation
    } 
}
/*
 caller of the constructor:
 
public static void main(String args[]) {
    Thread thread= new CSTARTFixed();
    thread.start();
