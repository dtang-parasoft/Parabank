This rule identifies code that overrides non "abstract" methods 
of a parent class with "abstract" methods. An error is reported
for the "abstract" method declaration that overrides the non-"abstract"
method.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In most cases, an inherited class should inherit all the 
methods from its ancestors. However, if a class overrides a 
non-abstract method into an abstract one, then any inherited
class would lose access to that method from its ancestors.
However, this behavior could still be desirable, since one class
can require all its inherited classes to implement the overriden methods.
