DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rules from this category are deprecated - see METRIC category.

Counts the number of "return" statements in a method.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule only checks explicit "return" statements (the implicit return
at the end of a "void" method is not counted).

This rule does not test "abstract", "native", or any methods that are
declared in the interface.

Jtest will report an error if the value is greater or equal 6.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Methods with multiple return points are easy to program but they are harder
to debug and maintain.
