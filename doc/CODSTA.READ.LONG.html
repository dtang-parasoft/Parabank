DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "long" integer constants that end in a lowercase 'l' 
instead of an uppercase 'L'.  It also identifies "int" constants which are in
places where a "long" integer is expected and which end in the number "1".  An 
error is reported for each occurrence.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Flag "long" integer constants which end in a lower-case "l"  (Default is on.)
-Flag constants which end in the number "1" where a "long" integer is expected
(Default is off.)

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Integer constants are "long" if they end in 'L' or 'l'.  'L' is preferred
over 'l' because 'l' (lowercase 'L') can easily be confused with '1'
(the number one).

Similarly, it is not recommended to have an "int" constant that 
ends in the number "1" in situations where a "long" is expected.  This
is because this can easily be confused with a long constant that ends 
in a lowercase letter 'l' by the person reading the code.  In situations
like this where a long constant is expected and the constant ends in the
number "1", it is best to put an "L" at the end of the constant instead 
of relying on implicit type conversions.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class LONG {
    public long getLongNumber () {
        long temp = 23434l;  // VIOLATION
        long temp2 = 234341;  // VIOLATION
        return temp;
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Make the 'l' uppercase.

package examples.rules.codsta.read;

public class LONGFixed {
    public long getLongNumber () {
        long temp = 23434L;  // FIXED
        long temp2 = 234341L;  // FIXED
        return temp;
    }
}
