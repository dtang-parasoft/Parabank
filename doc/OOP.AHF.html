DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code that hides inherited instance fields. An error
is reported if an inherited field is overridden by a child class.

You can choose the scope of checking. Fields are flagged if both the
ancestor fields and the inherited fields are within the specified scope.
- "public" field in ancestor class. (default is true)
- "protected" field in ancestor class. (default is true)
- package-private field in ancestor class. (default is true)
- "private" field in ancestor class. (default is false)
- "public" field in child class. (default is true)
- "protected" field in child class. (default is true)
- package-private field in child class. (default is true)
- "private" field in child class. (default is true)


- Fields to be ignored
  Fields that match with the list would not be flagged as error inherited fields.
  "serialVersionUID" is in the list by default.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Overriding a parent field obscures the inheritance relationship between the
parent and the child class.  It is also likely to be an unintended mistake.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.oop;

class SuperAHF {
    protected long a = 4;
}

public class AHF extends SuperAHF {
   protected int a = 5;  // VIOLATION
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The solution will depend on the design of the program, but may be as
simple as using the inherited member and removing the member declared
in the child class.
