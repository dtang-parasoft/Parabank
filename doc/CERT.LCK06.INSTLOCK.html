DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects access to shared static data that is protected with an instance lock.

"Programs must not use instance locks to protect static shared data because instance 
locks are ineffective when two or more instances of the class are created. Consequently, 
failure to use a static lock object leaves the shared state unprotected against 
concurrent access."[SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java;
LCK06-J. Do not use an instance lock to protect shared static data]

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule triggers when a lock on "this" object or its instance field is obtained
while accessing a static variable that is a field of the same class.
Flow Analysis will not report rule violation if it determines that the accessed variable
is read-only (i.e. it is final, its class is final, and it has no non-final fields).

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Excluded types" parameter allows you to enumerate fully qualified type names of classes that
the rule should ignore. The rule will assume that variables of the listed types are safe if they
are accessed in critical sections.

The following columns allow you to define different aspects of excluded types table:

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined types for Flow Analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name (wildcard)' column should be used to provide the fully qualified name 
  of the type.
  
* The 'Exclude the subtypes' option can be used to specify whether the subtypes of the listed type 
  should also be excluded.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers a violation:

public class Example
    implements Runnable
{
    private static int counter;

    private final Object lock = new Object();

    @Override
    public void run()
    {
        synchronized (lock) {
            counter++; // VIOLATION
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To repair the code, use a lock on a static object.

public class Repair
    implements Runnable
{
    private static int counter;

    private static final Object lock = new Object();

    @Override
    public void run()
    {
        synchronized (lock) {
            counter++; // NO VIOLATION
        }
    }
}
