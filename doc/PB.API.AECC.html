DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that none of the classes specified in the parameter list are
subclassed.  By default, nothing is checked.  The rule is provided as a 
customizable rule allowing the user to specify which types should not be 
subclassed.  A violation will be flagged for each type which extends one of the
types specified in the parameter list.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is a general version of the rules PB.NDC, PB.NXRE, and PB.EHM.  This
rule is provided because these rules are not customizable.   While PB.NDC, 
PB.NXRE, and PB.EHM check that 'java.lang.Error', 'java.lang.RuntimeException', 
'java.lang.Throwable', 'java.util.HashMap', and 'java.util.Hashtable' are not
subclassed, you may know of other classes which should not be subclassed.  This
rule provides an easy way of checking that these classes are not subclassed.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Types which should not be subclassed (Specify fully qualified type names)
    -By default, the list is empty.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are some cases where subclassing a class is likely to lead to bugs (See 
the "NOTES" section for some examples of this).  While separate rules are 
provided for some of the most common cases of this, this rule provides a way
for the user to specify additional classes which should not be subclassed.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This example assumes that "java.util.Vector" has been added to the parameter
list.  

package examples.rules.pb.api;

public class AECC extends Vector {  //VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Avoid extending any of the classes in the parameter list.  The specific repair
will depend on the situation, but one possibility is to use a wrapper class 
instead of extending a class.

package examples.rules.pb.api;

public class AECCFixed{  //FIXED
}
