DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects use of resources that have been freed. In particular, a violation is reported
when a reference to a freed resource is:

   * returned from a function,
   * passed as a parameter to a function,
   * used in a comparison operation (==, !=),
   * dereferenced, or
   * assigned to a variable/field/array element.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report violation when reference to freed resource is compared to null" check box
unsupresses/suppresses  violations where a reference to a freed resource is compared to null.
This may be allowed by the coding policy and application design. 
By default, such violations are not reported.

The "Report violation when reference to freed resource is compared to other references" check box
unsuppresses/suppresses violations where a references to a freed resource is compared to other
references. This may be allowed by the coding policy and application design.
By default, such violations are not reported.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter can result in more violations,
but possibly also more false positives, being reported. In this mode Flow 
Analysis will not check whether the path of the violation can be reached from
the beginning of the function. In some complicated cases, restricted analysis
depth may prevent Flow Analysis from completing the violation validation
procedure. If this happens, violation can be found only with this parameter 
turned on.

The types of resources handled by this rule can be viewed and edited in test configuration section:

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

import java.io.PrintStream;

public class Example
{
    void outputData(PrintStream ps, String data)
    {
        // do something
        ps.print(data);
        ps.close();
    }

    void process(PrintStream ps)
    {
        // do something
        outputData(ps, "Some data");
        ps.print("Some text"); // VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Removing the ps.close() call in the outputData() function repairs the example above.

import java.io.PrintStream;

public class Repair
{
    void outputData(PrintStream ps, String data)
    {
        // do something
        ps.print(data);
    }

    void process(PrintStream ps)
    {
        // do something
        outputData(ps, "Some data");
        ps.print("Some text"); // NO VIOLATION
    }

}
