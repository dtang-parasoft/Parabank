Do not put code other than logging code inside logging blocks [PB.CUB.CILB]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A common mistake when logging information using either "java.util.logging.
Logger" or "org.apache.log4j.Logger" is to accidentally include code unrelated 
to logging inside the logging block.  For instance, in the logging block shown 
below, an instance variable is set after the error message is logged.

if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
    String test = "error";
    log.debug(test);
    this._classVariable = false;    
} 

This block is intended for logging only, so it should not contain any code
unrelated to logging.  The assignment to the instance variable may have been
intended to go outside the logging block.  

This rule will flag a violation for any code inside an "if" statement that meets
the following conditions:

1.  The condition of the "if" statement is a call to check whether or not 
logging is enabled at a certain level (e.g., a call to the 'isDebugEnabled()' 
method of "org.apache.log4j.Logger" or the 'isLoggable()' method of "java.util.
logging.Logger").

2.  There is a call to a logging method inside the "if" block (e.g., a call
to the 'warning()' method of "java.util.logging.Logger" or the 'debug()' method
of "org.apache.log4j.Logger").

3.  There is some extra code after the call to the logging method described in
requirement #2.

The extra code may be in the logging block accidentally, so it should be 
inspected to make sure it is in the proper place.

This rule helps to identify "if" statements which were intended for logging but 
contain code unrelated to logging.  This helps to identify misplaced code.

DRAWBACKS

This rule may flag some false positives for code which was intentionally 
included inside a logging block.  Although rare, there may be a reason to 
include code not directly related to logging inside a logging block.  For 
example, the last line of the following "if" block obviously belongs inside the 
body of the "if" statement:

if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
    String debugMsg = "message";
    log.debug(debugMsg);
    this._isDebugMessageLogged = false;  //Code will be flagged even though it
                                         //belongs in the "if" block.
}

You should verify that the flagged code was supposed to go outside the logging
block before fixing the violation.  If this is the case, you can simply move the
code to after the logging block. 

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class CILB_Fixed {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger("examples.rules.pb.cub.CILB_Fixed");
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if(LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.WARNING)) {
            String warnMsg = "Warning message";
            LOGGER.warning(warnMsg);
        } 
        System.err.println("Inside 'main()' method");
    } 
}
