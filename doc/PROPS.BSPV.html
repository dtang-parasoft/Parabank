DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If spurious white spaces are included at the end of the values of properties, it
may cause bugs in the code which reads the ".properties" file.  This rule will 
flag a violation for each property value in a ".properties" file which is a 
valid numeric or boolean value except for extra whitespace at the end of the
property value.  If the value of the property is not a correctly formatted 
boolean or numeric value, the rule will assume that the extra whitespace was 
intentional.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If there is extra space at the end of a boolean or numeric value in a property
value, the property may not be read correctly if the code reading the 
".properties" file does not take into account the possible extra whitespace.  
For instance, if the following property entry appears in a ".properties" file:

value=true 
(with an extra space at the end of "true")

code that reads the property "value" will read it as "true ".  If the code 
compares the value with "true" without first calling "trim()", the code may not
work.

#VIOLATION- has an extra tab after "true"
a=true	
#VIOLATION- has an extra space after "123"	
b=123

If the extra white space was accidental, remove it.

#FIXED- eliminated extra tab
a=true
#FIXED- eliminated extra space
b=123
