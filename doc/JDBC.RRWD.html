Close JDBC resources in "finally" blocks [JDBC.RRWD]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies all method-local JDBC variables of types "Statement" or
"ResultSet" that are not closed by the method. An error is reported for each 
occurrence.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v4.5



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DEPRECATED
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is deprecated and has been replaced by BD.RES.LEAKS.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks only for "Statement" and "ResultSet" variables. Another rule
(JDBC.CDBC) deals with "Connection" objects. This rule will not check unused 
resource objects.

<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Erratic Application Behavior
category: Application Denial of Service

If database resources are not closed and released appropriately, attackers might 
perform an App DOS attack to exhaust database connections, preventing other 
valid users from getting the connections. See BENEFITS for more information.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore JDBC connection is created by the following types
   Default value: 
     org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Failure to close and release database connections can make other users wait
for connections for a long time. If you are using the WebSphere Application Server,
a JDBC resource that is left unclosed will be reaped and returned by the server 
after a timeout period. As a result, other users will have to wait for a timeout
to occur, so resources should alway be explicitly closed.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.jdbc;

import java.sql.*;

public class RRWD {
    void test0 () {  // VIOLATION: 'close ()' never called for JDBC variables
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;
        try {
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection ("some url");
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            rs = stmt.executeQuery ("some query");
        } catch (Exception e) {}
        finally {
            try {  // VIOLATION: 'stmt' and 'rs' are not closed. 
                if (conn != null) {
                    conn.close();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {}
        }
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Ensure that your code is structured to close and release JDBC resources in all
cases, even in exception and error conditions.

package examples.rules.jdbc;

import java.sql.*;

public class RRWDFixed {
    void test0() {  // FIXED
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;
        try {
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("some url");
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            rs = stmt.executeQuery("some query");
        } catch (Exception e) {
        } finally {
            try {  // FIXED: 'stmt' and 'rs' closed in "finally" block
                if (rs != null) {
                    rs.close();
                }
                if (stmt != null) {
                    stmt.close();
                }
                if (conn != null) {
                    conn.close();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
            }
        }
    }
}
