DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a violation for all methods which meet all of the following 
conditions:

1. The method is declared within an "abstract" class.
2. The method does not contain any Java statements. That is, the method has an
empty body (except for possibly some comments).
3. The method is not declared "abstract".
4. The method is not declared "final". "final" methods are not intended to be
implemented by a child class.
5. The method is not declared "private". "private" methods are not intended to
be implemented by a child class.

Such methods could be declared "abstract" since they do not perform any
operations.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Methods in "abstract" classes which do not have any Java statements in their
bodies should be declared "abstract" so that extending classes will have to
provide their own implementations of these methods.  Since these methods do not
have a meaningful implementation, it is likely that they were intended to be
overridden anyway. Declaring them "abstract" will force child classes to
override these methods.
