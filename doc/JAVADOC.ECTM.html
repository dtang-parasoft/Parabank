This rule would not report any violation if the Javadoc is not present,
since another rule JAVADOC.PJDM would report missing Javadoc.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-check "public" methods/annotation member types (default as true)
-check "protected" methods/annotation member types (default as false)
-check "package-private" methods/annotation member types (default as false)
-check "private" methods/annotation member types (default as false)

-do not check classes with the following string(default as internal)
If the string is in a single line comment directly before the top level class
declaration, the c-style block comments will have no effect.
        //internal
        public class NOCHECK
         /*internal*/
        public class CHECKNORMALLY
-do not check files within the following packages(default as .*internal.*)

Users can enter a list of tags they wish to enforce for the methods.
By default, @since is in the list.
