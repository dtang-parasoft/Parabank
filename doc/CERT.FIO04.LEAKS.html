DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps to ensure that allocated resources are deallocated on all paths.
Violations of the rule identify execution paths in an application where resources
are leaked.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Erratic Application Behavior

Failure to close resources may lead to starvation, which could have
security implications.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Assume resource references can be stored by third-party methods of the following
types" set of parameters allows you to determine how strict the rule is when a reference
to a resource may be stored by a third-party method. For example, if there is a
third-party method SpecialCollection.add() and a resource is passed as a parameter
to this method, it will be stored in a collection and may later be closed by iterating
over the collection. Since Flow Analysis does not know the exact behavior of arbitrary
third-party methods, it behaves in either of the following ways:

   * With "Any methods" parameter enabled (the default approach), Flow Analysis assumes
	 that any third-party method may store a reference to a resource if the resource is
	 passed into the method. This prevents the rule from reporting false positives if
	 the resource is later closed using the stored reference. However, this may also
	 lead to some false negatives (real leaks are not reported as violations) if the
	 method does not store a reference to the resource.
     
   * With "Methods with names matching the pattern" parameter enabled, Flow Analysis
	 assumes that any third-party method which matches regex may store a reference to
	 a resource if the resource is passed into the method. This prevents the rule from reporting
	 false positives if the resource is later closed using the stored reference. However,
	 this may also lead to some false negatives (real leaks are not reported as violations)
	 if the method does not store a reference to the resource.

   * With all the parameters disabled, Flow Analysis takes a more aggressive approach and it
	 assumes that third-party methods do not affect resources in any way. This approach
	 may lead to some false positives, but it will not overlook any of the real leaks
	 that the default approach may miss.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter can result in more violations,
but possibly also more false positives, being reported. In this mode Flow 
Analysis will not check whether the path of the violation can be reached from
the beginning of the function. In some complicated cases, restricted analysis
depth may prevent Flow Analysis from completing the violation validation
procedure. If this happens, violation can be found only with this parameter 
turned on.

The types of resources handled by this rule can be viewed and edited in test configuration section:

<PRE>
Having a strict policy with respect to closing resources helps to make an application more
robust by preventing resource starvation.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example which triggers violations:

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public abstract class Example
{
    public String readData(String sRequest)
    {
        String sResult = null;
        int type = getRequestType(sRequest);
        try {
            InputStream input = getSource(sRequest, type);
            byte[] bytes = new byte[256];
            input.read(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
            sResult = new String(bytes);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot read data");
        }
        return sResult; // at this point reference to input stream is lost and it is left not closed
    } // VIOLATION

    public InputStream getSource(String sLocation, int type)
        throws Exception
    {
        InputStream source = null;
        switch (type) {
            case 1:
                source = _socket.getInputStream();
                break;
            default:
                source = new FileInputStream("...");
        }
        return source;
    }

    Socket _socket;

    protected abstract int getRequestType(String sRequest);
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To fix this problem, close the stream:

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public abstract class Repair
{
    public String readData(String sRequest)
    {
        String sResult = null;
        int type = getRequestType(sRequest);
        try (InputStream input = getSource(sRequest, type)) {
            byte[] bytes = new byte[256];
            input.read(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
            sResult = new String(bytes);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot read data");
        }
        return sResult;
    } // NO VIOLATION

    public InputStream getSource(String sLocation, int type)
        throws Exception
    {
        InputStream source = null;
        switch (type) {
            case 1:
                source = _socket.getInputStream();
                break;
            default:
                source = new FileInputStream("...");
        }
        return source;
    }

    Socket _socket;

    protected abstract int getRequestType(String sRequest);
}
