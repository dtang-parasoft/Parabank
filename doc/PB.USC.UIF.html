DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "else if" or "else" cases that are not reachable. An error
is reported for each occurrence.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore "static final boolean" constants and "boolean" literals (default true)
    -Boolean constants and variables which always evaluate to the same value are
     less likely to be misplaced expressions. Instead, they could be conditional
     expressions that are used as flags to toggle on or off code segments.
     Enabling this parameter will cause these conditional statements to not 
     be flagged as errors.
     The following cases will be ignored:
        -Expressions consisting of just a single boolean constant or variable,
         as well as expressions where a single boolean constant or variable is
         negated using the "!".
        -Comparisons of a single boolean constant or variable to "true" or
         "false" will also not be flagged. This is equivalent to the case of a
         single boolean constant or variable and may indicate that the constant
         or variable is being used as a flag to toggle code.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Since an unreachable case would never be executed, it should be removed.
However, in most of the cases, unreachable cases are unintended. They could be
caused by misplaced conditions or incorrect logic, such a logic flaw should be
fixed to ensure correct behavior of the code.

        else if (score == 100) {  //VIOLATION: unreachable case
            return "PERFECT";
