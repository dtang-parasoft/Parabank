DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

When overriding the 'setUp()' and 'tearDown()' methods of 'junit.framework.
TestCase', there are several conventions that you must follow in order to assure
that these methods are implemented correctly.  This rule will check the 
following conventions:

1.  Any exceptions thrown by the call to 'super.setUp()' should not be caught.
An exception thrown by the call to 'super.setUp()' should cause the setup to 
fail and the tests to not be executed.  This means that, instead of catching any
exceptions which are thrown by a call to 'super.setUp()', you should declare 
them to be thrown by including "throws Exception" in the declaration of the
'setUp()' method.  

2.  The call to 'super.setUp()' should be the first statement of the overriding
version of the 'setUp()' method.  The setup of the superclasses should occur 
before the setup of the current class. 

3.  The overriding version of the 'tearDown()' method should be enclosed by a
"try"/"finally" block with a call to 'super.tearDown()' in the body of the 
"finally" block.  That way, the tear-down method of the parent class will always
be executed at the end of the execution of the tear-down method for the current
class (whether or not any exceptions are thrown by the 'tearDown()' method of
the child class).

This rule will flag a violation for classes which extend 'junit.framework.
TestCase' and override the 'setUp()' and/or 'tearDown()' methods but which do 
not follow the conventions mentioned above.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

As mentioned in the "DESCRIPTION" section, there are three parts to this rule.
The benefits of each part are as follows:

1.  The 'setUp()' method must throw an exception whenever the call to 
'super.setUp()' throws an exception because no tests should be executed if the 
setup fails.  If exceptions thrown by the call to 'super.setUp()' are caught, 
the tests will still be executed even though the setup failed.

2.  The call to 'super.setUp()' must come first in the 'setUp()' method because 
a test class may use functionality from the superclass.  The superclass should 
be initialized immediately by calling its 'setup()' method to ensure that 
functionality from the superclass is not used before it is initialized. 

3.  The call to 'super.tearDown()' should be placed within the "finally" portion
of a "try" block which encompasses the whole 'tearDown()' method to make sure 
that the 'tearDown()' method of the superclass is called even if the 
'tearDown()' method of the subclass throws an exception.
