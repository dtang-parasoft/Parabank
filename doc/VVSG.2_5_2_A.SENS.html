DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases when sensitive internal data is made available to the end-user.
This may pose a threat to application security, as insight into the internal structure
of a program may enable an attacker to construct a request that breaks the normal program
flow and/or provide the attacker with higher access privileges.

The sources of sensitive data:

   * toString(): The toString() method is often implemented to display information that is
     internal to an object and should not be made available to the end-user.

   * Reflection: Reflection allows a program to examine and modify its own structure and
     behavior at runtime. For this reason, objects of the following classes that are used
     in the reflection mechanism are considered sensitive:
     
      * java.lang.Class
      * java.reflect.AccessibleObject
      * java.lang.reflect.Field
      * java.lang.reflect.Method
      * java.lang.reflect.Constructor

   * Exceptions: Thrown exceptions should be hidden from the user.
     Any instance of java.lang.Throwable is sensitive.

   * Environment: Environment variables may contain information that should be hidden
     from the regular user of the system.

   * System Properties

The rule prevents leakage of sensitive data through the following: 

   * AWT API
   * Swing API
   * SWT API
   * JFace API
   * Apache ECS API
   * java.io.Console
   * javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream
   * javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter
   * java.io.PrintWriter

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Exposing Sensitive Data

Enforces 'A3 - Sensitive Data Exposure', #3 from the OWASP Top 10 2017 list.

Sensitive information leakage may be a critical problem for applications that need to be secure.
Many security attacks occur as a result of an attacker gaining insight into the structure
of an application, then using this insight to devise input data that makes the application behave
in an abnormal way. The application then ends up granting the attacker higher access privileges than he should have.
Thus, for security critical applications, it's important to keep information about the program's internal
structure hidden-- so that potential attackers cannot access it. In particular, exceptions, stack traces, and
method and class names should never be made available to the end user.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Dangerous methods" parameter allows you to specify methods the rule
considers to be dangerous. The rule triggers when sensitive data is passed as
a parameter to a dangerous method.
Fill in the following columns to configure a dangerous method.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the dangerous method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a dangerous method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.

The "Validating methods" parameter allows you to specify methods that can
validate tainted data. The rule assumes that parameters, target objects, and
return values are benign if one of the validating methods is called. 
Fill in the following columns to configure a validating method and specify
the data it affects.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the validating method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a validating method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.
- "'this' object is validated" - if enabled,  the method cleans the object it
    is called on.
- "Returns validated data" - if enabled, the method cleans its return value.
- "Validated parameters" - specifies which method parameters are cleaned by
    the method. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all method parameters are cleaned.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter allows you to enable or disable
reporting unvalidated violations. If enabled, Flow  Analysis does not check
whether the path of the violation can be reached from the beginning of
the function. Enabling this parameter may be useful in complex cases when
restricted analysis depth prevents Flow Analysis from completing the violation
validation procedure, but it may result in reporting false positives.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here are two examples which trigger a violation:

import java.io.IOException;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Example
{
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
    {
        try {
            Class.forName("someClass");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            try {
                resp.getWriter().write(e.getMessage()); // VIOLATION
            } catch (IOException e1) {}
        }
    }

    public void method()
    {
        Object obj = new Object();
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Object " + obj.toString(), "Message", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE); // VIOLATION
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code will not trigger a violation:

import java.io.IOException;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public abstract class Repair
{
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
    {
        try {
            Class.forName("someClass");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            try {
                resp.getWriter().write(validate(e.getMessage())); // NO VIOLATION
            } catch (IOException e1) {}
        }
    }

    public void method()
    {
        Object obj = new Object();
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Object " + validate(obj.toString()), "Message", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE); // NO VIOLATION
    }

    /** do the validation of the string here */
    public abstract String validate(String str);
}
