DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "public" and "protected" classes that are not as inaccessible
as possible. An error is reported for each occurrence.

Global analysis is required in this rule.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Ignore "protected" types which can be made package-private
    -Default is "false".
    -If this parameter is enabled, the rule will only flag a violation on
     "protected" types if they can be made "private".
-Allow inner types to be declared "private"
    -Default is "true".
    -When this parameter is disabled, the rule will not suggest for you to
     convert any inner types (member types) from "public" or "protected" to
     "private".  The rule will only check for inner types which can be converted
     from "public" or "protected" to package-private in this case.
    -"private" inner types require a synthetic accessor method when their
     members are accessed from an enclosing class.  Although this is allowed by
     the Java compiler, this practice is discouraged.  Our rule OPT.ICGA will
     warn you about this, as will the Eclipse compiler if the compiler setting
     "Access to a non-accessible member of an enclosing type" is set to "Error"
     or "Warning".  If you want to avoid writing code which produces these
     errors, you should disable this parameter setting.
-Ignore the classes that correspond to these qualified names
    -Default includes "android.app.Activity, android.app.Service,
     android.content.ContentProvider, android.app.Application."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Following this rule makes the code more object-oriented and makes its
dependencies easier to understand.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change the class' accessibility or document the reason for the excessive
accessibility.
