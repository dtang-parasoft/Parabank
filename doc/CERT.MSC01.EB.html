DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies "if", "for", "while", "do while", "else" and "switch" statements 
with empty bodies. An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Two old rules "PB.FEB" and "PB.IEB", that check for empty bodies of "if" and "for"
statements, are deprecated since this new rule covers their functionalities. 

This rule will not flag a violation for statements with empty bodies which 
perform some useful work in their parenthesized blocks.  For instance, a "while"
statement which has an empty body but updates some local variable in its 
condition will not be flagged as a violation if that local variable is used 
later.  In this case, the empty body is probably not a bug.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

category: Erratic Application Behavior

Unintended empty control statements may cause erratic behavior as well as create
security holes if important checks are bypassed.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Elements that would be flagged as empty bodies
     Empty body could refer to 
     -empty statement (a single semicolon) or 
     -empty block (curly braces with nothing inside)
     
     Users can choose to flag either one or both of them as empty bodies.
     Besides, users also have control over which control statement blocks 
     would be flagged. They include "if", "else", "for", "while", "do while"
     and "switch".
     
-Report only if the empty statement is on the same line as the control statement.
 (Default is "true") 
     -This parameter only applies for empty statements (that is, semicolons by
      themselves).  It does not apply for empty blocks.  
     -If an empty statement (semicolon) is on a separate line from the rest of
      the control statement, a violation will not be flagged when this parameter
      is selected.  This situation is less likely to be a bug than the situation
      where an empty statement appears on the same line as the rest of the 
      control statement.   



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A conditional statement that is immediately followed by a closing statement
(e.g. a semicolon) is usually a typo.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class EB {
    void method (int i) {
        if (i &lt; 0) ;  // VIOLATION
            System.out.println("negative i"); // This always gets printed
    }
}

The 'println ()' statement will always be executed regardless
of the value of 'i'. 



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the unnecessary semicolon.

package examples.rules.pb.typo;

public class EBFixed {
    void method (int i) {
        if (i &lt; 0)  // FIXED
            System.out.println("negative i");
    }
}
