DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

The Number of Comment Lines metrics measure how many lines have at least one
comment, have the beginning or ending of a comment, or are inside a comment.
The three metrics allow you to measure how well the analyzed code is commented.
This metric counts the number of comment lines that belong to methods,
including comments that precede the method definition.
