DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

Maintainability Index is a composite metric that incorporates a number of
traditional source code metrics into a single number that indicates relative
maintainability. 

Threshold evaluation for this index suffers from limitations regarding 
language independence or used technology.

Don Coleman analysis software systems and evaluates following thresholds 
for this index (see REFERENCES section):

1) Maintainability Index &lt; 65 is a poor maintainability
2) 65 &lt; Maintainability Index &lt; 85 is fair maintainability
3) 85 &lt; Maintainability Index is excellent maintainability

But in Java world you should consider this numbers as suggestion 
because this analysis was created before Java language had appeared.

Formula
The maintainability index of a type is:
MI = 171 - 5.2*ln(avgHV) - 0.23*avgSCC - 16.2*ln(avgLOC) + 50*sin(sqrt(2.46*CMR))

Where:
- avgHV is the average Halstead Volume of methods of the type. 
- avgSCC is the average Strict Cyclomatic Complexity of methods of the type. 
- avgLOC is the average number of lines of code of methods of the type. 
- CMR is average percent of comment lines of code of methods of the type.
