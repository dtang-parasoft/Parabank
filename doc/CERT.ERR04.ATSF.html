DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By default, this rule will flag a violation for any case where a "finally" block 
will be exited by a "throw" statement.  Optionally, it can also be parameterized
to flag cases where a "finally" block is exited by means of a "return", "break", 
or "continue" statement or a call to a method or constructor which may throw a 
checked exception that is not caught within the "finally" block.  Exiting a 
"finally" block in one of these ways is called an abrupt exit, and abrupt exits 
can lead to unexpected results.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There is some overlap between this rule and the rule PB.ARCF if you run this 
rule with the parameters set to check "return" statements.  PB.ARCF checks that
there are no "return" statements inside "finally" blocks only if there is at 
least one "return" statement in the corresponding "try" or "catch" blocks.  This
rule enforces that there are no "return" statements within "finally" blocks at 
all, so it is more general than PB.ARCF.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

<PRE>

category: Unsafe Error Handling and Logging

Throwing an exception from within a "finally" block can indicate improper error
handling and application instability.  "finally" blocks are supposed to contain
only code to clean up after a "try" block executes.  If you throw an exception 
from the "finally" block, it indicates that you are not properly recovering from
any exception which was thrown in the "try" block.  Throwing an exception from a 
"finally" block could also cause some of the "clean up" code to not be executed.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

What to Check
-"throw" statements (default true)
    -allow rethrowing of exceptions from within "finally" blocks (default false)
        throw statements nested in "catch" blocks are not flagged
-"return" statements (default false)
-"break" and "continue" statements (default false)
-method calls which throw uncaught exceptions (default false)


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Abrupt exits from "finally" blocks are very likely to lead to bugs.  This is 
due to the fact that the "finally" block is guaranteed to execute regardless of 
whether the corresponding "try" block exited normally or abruptly.  The abrupt
exit from the "finally" block can cause the reason for the abrupt exit from the
"try" block to be hidden.  For instance, if there is a "return" statement in 
both a "try" block (or a "catch" block) and a "finally" block, the "return" 
value in the "finally" block will hide the other return value since the 
"finally" block is guaranteed to execute.  A similar situation can happen with
exceptions thrown in "finally" blocks hiding exceptions thrown in "try" or 
"catch" blocks.  This situation can be very confusing.

Also, "finally" blocks can contain important statements that must be executed. 
If a "finally" block is exited abruptly, any statements which have not yet been
reached will not get executed.  This can cause bugs.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In this example, the exception thrown by the user in the "throw" statement will 
hide the exceptions thrown by either the "BufferedReader" or "FileReader" 
constructor, which is probably not the correct behavior.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

import java.io.IOException;

public class ATSF
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException {
        java.io.BufferedReader _in = null;
        try {
            _in = new java.io.BufferedReader (
                  new java.io.FileReader (
                  args[0]));
        } finally {
            throw new IOException("Oops");  // VIOLATION: Explicit "throw" in finally
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove the statement that causes the abrupt exit from the "finally" block.  In 
this case, that is the "throw" statement.

package examples.rules.pb.cub;

public class ATSFFixed
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException {
        java.io.BufferedReader _in = null;
        try {
            _in = new java.io.BufferedReader(new java.io.FileReader(args[0]));
        } finally {
            //FIXED
        }
    }
}
