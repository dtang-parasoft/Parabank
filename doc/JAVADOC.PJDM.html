DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies methods that lack Javadoc comments
or descriptions within the Javadoc comments.
An error is reported for each occurrence.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Quick Fix All" feature is not always available for this rule because some
of the Quick Fixes require user input.  These cases must be Quick Fixed
individually.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Check if javadoc comment is missing (default as true)
-Check if javadoc description is missing (default as false)
    Javadoc should give a brief description of the commenting method.
-check "public" methods/annotation member types (default as true)
-check "protected" methods/annotation member types (default as false)
-check "package-private" methods/annotation member types (default as false)
-check "private" methods/annotation member types (default as false)

-Ignore methods/annotation member types with fully qualified names (in regular expression): (^main$ is in the list by default)
    Allows you to provide a list of methods to ignore. If a method's name
    matches any of the regular expressions, it will be exempt from this rule.
    For example, if "^main$" is added to the list, then a method with name "main"
    would not be identified as a rule violation-- even if it does not have Javadoc.

-Ignore "abstract" methods (default as false)
    Prevents this rule from checking abstract methods.

-Ignore overriding methods (default as false)
    Prevents this rule from checking overriding methods if the method that is
    being overridden has a valid Javadoc comment.

-Ignore overriding methods where the source code for the overridden method is
 not available (default is "true")
    -This parameter is only available if the "Ignore overriding methods"
     parameter is selected.
    -Some methods override a method for which the source code is not available.
     For example, the source code is not available for any method defined in the
     JDK.  If the source code for an overridden method is not available, Jtest
     cannot tell if there is a valid Javadoc comment for the overridden method.
     Leaving this parameter turned on will prevent false positives from arising
     due to this issue.  If this parameter is turned on, Jtest will assume that
     any method for which there is no source code has a valid Javadoc comment.

-Ignore method declarations within interfaces (default as false)
    Prevents this rule from checking interface method declarations.

-Ignore setter and getter methods (default is true)
    Prevents this rule from checking setter and getter method declarations.

-Ignore method declarations within local classes and anonymous classes (default as true)
    Prevents this rule from checking method declarations within local classes
    and anonymous classes. Since local classes and anonymous classes would not be
    visible outside their current scope, Javadoc could sometimes be omitted in these
    cases.

-Ignore method declarations within private member classes (default as true)
    Prevents this rule from checking method declarations within private member classes.
    Since method declarations within private member classes would not be visible
    outside the enclosing compilation units regardless of method visibility, Javadoc
    could sometimes be omitted in these cases.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Commenting your code is a good way to document its behavior.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.javadoc;

/** Comments about this class
 */
public class PJDM {

    public void method () {}  // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Provide Javadoc comments for each method.

package examples.rules.javadoc;

/** Comments about this class
 */
public class PJDMFixed {

     /** Comments about this method
      */
    public void method () {}  // FIXED
