Avoid dereferencing null objects [PB.RE.PNPD]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule searches for possible attempts to dereference a null pointer.  It
will flag violations such as the following:

if(w== null){
    w.close();
}

It searches for places where a method call is made on an object that is likely
to be null based on the flow control.  It also will detect similar errors in
the bodies of the boolean expression portions of if-statements, such as the
following:

if(w== null &amp;&amp; w.isOpen()){
}

It will also flag a case where a null literal is thrown, since this is an
attempt to dereference it.

DEPRECATED
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is deprecated and has been replaced by BD.EXCEPT.NP.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Enforcing this rule will help prevent bugs because it will catch many potential
NullPointerExceptions before runtime.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is deprecated because returns false positive violations. Instead this please use BD.EXCEPT.NP rule.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.pb.re;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class PNPD {
    public static void close(InputStream stream) throws IOException {
        if (stream == null)
            stream.close(); // VIOLATION
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        close(null);
    }
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Fix the code logic so that you never call a method on an object if that object
is null.  In this case, the fix is just to change the "==" operator to a "!="
operator.

package examples.rules.pb.re;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class PNPDFixed {
    public static void close(InputStream stream) throws IOException {
        if (stream != null)  // FIXED
            stream.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        close(null);
    }
}
