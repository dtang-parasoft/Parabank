DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies redundant "throws" clauses in method declarations.
An error is reported if a "throws" clause is a subclass of other exception types
that are declared to be thrown by the same method or if an identical exception
type is declared to be thrown before it.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There is a Quick Fix for this rule to remove the redundant "throws" declaration,
but this may not be the best fix.  For instance, consider the case where an
exception is thrown which is a subclass of another exception type which is also
thrown.  The Quick Fix is to remove the subclass exception type, but it may
actually be better to remove the superclass exception type.  Of course, it is
only possible to remove the superclass exception type if all subclasses of that
type which are thrown by the method (as well as all subclasses of the type which
are thrown in overriding versions of the method) are specifically declared to be
thrown.  If this is the case, it is probably better to remove the more general
type so that the method declares the specific exception types which are thrown.
The "Quick Fix All" feature is enabled for this rule for convenience, but you
should review all of the violations individually if possible.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A redundant "throws" clause does not add any meaningful properties to the
method declaration. Following this rule simplifies code and makes it less
error-prone.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.uc;

import java.io.*;

public class ARTD {
    public void myMethod() throws IOException, FileNotFoundException {  //VIOLATION
                                      //FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException
        throw new FileNotFoundException();
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Remove any unnecessary "throws" clauses so that there are no more redundant
"throws" clauses.  Note that, in this case, you could choose to remove either
the superclass type (IOException) or the subclass type (FileNotFoundException).
See the "NOTES" section for more details about cases like this.

package examples.rules.uc;

import java.io.*;

public class ARTDFixed {
    public void myMethod () throws FileNotFoundException {  //FIXED
        throw new FileNotFoundException();
    }
}
