DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies code where 'getName()' gets 
the name of a class. A message is reported for each
occurrence.

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Backdoor Vulnerabilities
category: Malicious Code

Use of the 'getName()' method of "java.lang.Class" often 
indicates logic which relies on comparing classes by name.
Code logic should not rely on comparing classes by name. If 
classes are compared by name, it may be possible for an
attacker to add a malicious class with the same package name 
and class name as the expected class.  This may allow for the
execution of code in the malicious class instead of the 
execution of code in the expected class.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore calls passed to logging methods (default false)
    Logging methods are not usually used to determine program flow. Enabling
    this parameter will ignore calls to "getName()" which are passed directly to
    a logging method. A method is considered a logging method if it belongs to
    one of the following common logging classes: "java.util.logging.Logger",
    "org.apache.log4j.Logger"
    
-Ignore calls passed to "print" methods (default false)
    Print methods are not usually used to determine program flow. Enabling this
    parameter will ignore calls to "getName()" which are directly passed to a
    "print" method. A method is considered a "print" method if its name contains
    the word "print" (case insensitive)

-Ignore calls passed to throw statements (default false)
    Throw statements are not usually used to determine program flow. Enabling
    this parameter will ignore calls to "getName()" which are passed directly to
    a throw statement.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The class name obtained from 'getName()' gives only a loose
description of the class. Consequently, it is risky to compare
class identities using only the name.  If possible, you should
compare classes using the ".class" objects instead of the names.

Moreover, class names could also be sensitive information, and 
should be handled carefully.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

package examples.rules.security.bv;

public class AUG {
    public static void vectorMethod(Object obj) {
        if(obj.getClass().getName().equals("java.util.Vector")) {  //VIOLATION
            //Execute some code in the "Vector" class.
        }
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Inspect how the String derived from 'getName()' is used and ensure 
that it would not cause security vulnerabilities.  In this case, you
can avoid the possible security vulnerability by comparing the ".class"
objects of the parameter and of "java.util.Vector" instead of just 
comparing the names.  This may prevent an attacker from adding a class
called "java.util.Vector" with malicious code that will then be executed.

package examples.rules.security.bv;

import java.util.Vector;

public class AUG_Fixed {
    public static void vectorMethod(Object obj) {
        if(obj.getClass().equals(Vector.class)) {  //FIXED
            //Execute some code in the "Vector" class.
        }
    }
}
