DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that concrete classes are not used as the superclasses of abstract
classes.  A violation will be flagged for the declaration of each abstract class
which is declared to extend a concrete class.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Abstract classes represent general types and, as such, should be defined
at the top of the type hierarchy with the concrete implementations of the abstract
classes coming at the bottom of the hierarchy.  Having abstract classes which are
subclasses of concrete classes violates this general practice and is confusing.

package examples.rules.codsta;

import java.util.Vector;

public abstract class ACECC extends Vector { //VIOLATION

REPAIR

<PRE>

Make the class that you are declaring concrete, or change its superclass to make it
abstract.

package examples.rules.codsta;

import java.util.Vector;

public class ACECCFixed extends Vector { //FIXED
