DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when data that comes directly from the end-user and is
written into a file has not been checked.


This rule triggers when tainted data is passed to the following methods:

   * FileOutputStream.write(...)
   * FileWriter.write(...)
   * File.write(...)

SECURITY RELEVANCE

category: Input-Based Attacks

Data that is written to a file can be used to form other requests (such as SQL or XML or XPath etc.).
Consequently, an attacker can provide malicious data as file contents, which can lead to executing dangerous requests and/or revealing information that was intended to be private/secure.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Sources of tainted data" parameter allows you to specify which data
sources the rule considers to be sources of tainted data. You can specify
the following sources:
   * Servlet requests
   * Files
   * Pipes
   * Return values of remote methods
   * Reflection methods
   * Environment variables and system properties
   * Spring environment properties
   * JMS (Java Message Service)
   * Database
   * Stream-oriented APIs (streams, readers and channels)
   * Console
   * GUI controls
   * Parameters of entry point methods
   * Parameters of remote methods
   * Native methods
   * Non-validating Struts forms
   * Network
   * Sockets
   * Spring http requests

The "Validating methods" parameter allows you to specify methods that can
validate tainted data. The rule assumes that parameters, target objects, and
return values are benign if one of the validating methods is called. 
Fill in the following columns to configure a validating method and specify
the data it affects.
- "Enabled" - enables or disables the validating method. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the method to be a validating method.
- "Fully qualified type name (wildcard)" - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the method. You can use "*" for a method declared
    in any type.
- "Method name (wildcard)" - specifies the name of the method.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to methods with the specified name that are defined
    in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both instance
    and non-instance methods.
- "'this' object is validated" - if enabled,  the method cleans the object it
    is called on.
- "Returns validated data" - if enabled, the method cleans its return value.
- "Validated parameters" - specifies which method parameters are cleaned by
    the method. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all method parameters are cleaned.

The "Do not consider numerical data tainted" parameter allows you to specify
how the rule treats numerical data. If enabled, the rule assumes that numerical
data (both primitive data types and objects) is never tainted, even if it
comes from an untrusted source.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter allows you to enable or disable
reporting unvalidated violations. If enabled, Flow  Analysis does not check
whether the path of the violation can be reached from the beginning of
the function. Enabling this parameter may be useful in complex cases when
restricted analysis depth prevents Flow Analysis from completing the violation
validation procedure, but it may result in reporting false positives.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Consider an application that stores security-specific data in a file on the server,
and then uses its contents e.g. to compile SQL queries. Placing untrusted, unverified data
in such a file may lead to significant security violations (for example, SQL injection, etc.).

In this example, there are two methods: one that stores data into a file, and another that
reads from that file and constructs an SQL query:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

public class Example
{
    public void save(HttpServletRequest req)
        throws IOException
    {
        String sData = req.getParameter("user_params");
        FileOutputStream fOut = new FileOutputStream("user_data");
        fOut.write(sData.getBytes()); // VIOLATION
        fOut.close();
    }

    public void read()
        throws IOException
    {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("user_data"));
        String sRequestParams = reader.readLine();
        String sQuery = "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE " + sRequestParams;
        // execute this SQL query and show user received data
    }
}

In this case, preparing a specially-prepared string as a request parameter
(e.g. " 1=1 LEFT JOIN users ON 1=1") may enable to attacker to access private data.

Validate data prior to its usage:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

public abstract class Repair
{
    public void save(HttpServletRequest req)
        throws IOException
    {
        String sData = validate(req.getParameter("user_params"));
        FileOutputStream fOut = new FileOutputStream("user_data");
        fOut.write(sData.getBytes()); // NO VIOLATION
        fOut.close();
    }

    public void read()
        throws IOException
    {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("user_data"));
        String sRequestParams = reader.readLine();
        String sQuery = "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE " + sRequestParams;
        // execute this SQL query and show user received data
    }

    public abstract String validate(Object obj);
}
