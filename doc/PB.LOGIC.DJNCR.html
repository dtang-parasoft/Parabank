DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that the return value of a call to "readLine()" is not ignored 
after it is checked to see whether or not it is "null".  A violation will be
flagged for each place where the return value of a call to "readLine()" is not
stored into a variable or used in some way other than to compare it against
"null".  This rule only checks calls to the "readLine()" method declared in the
"java.io.Reader" class.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If the return value of a call to "readLine()" is not null, the programmer will
usually want to use this return value.  If the return value is not stored in a
variable or used immediately, it is lost since calling "readLine()" again will 
read a different line.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.pb.logic;

import java.io.*;

public class DJNCR {
    public static void main(String[] args){    
        BufferedReader br= new BufferedReader(new StringReader(""));
        try{
            if(br.readLine()!= null){  //VIOLATION
                System.out.println("readLine() was not null");
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e){}
    }

Store the return value of "readLine()" into a variable or use it some other way.

package examples.rules.pb.logic;

import java.io.*;

public class DJNCRFixed {
    public static void main(String[] args){    
        BufferedReader br= new BufferedReader(new StringReader(""));
        try{
            String line= br.readLine();
            if(line!= null){  //VIOLATION
                System.out.println("The line was "+line);
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e){}
    }
}
