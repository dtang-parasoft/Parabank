DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies any "private" field that is accessed in only
one method. An error is reported for each occurrence.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The fact that a private field is only accessed by a single
method often indicates that the field can be replaced by a
local variable. However, there are several cases where a
field is accessed in only one method, but can NOT be
converted to a local variable.
For example:

public class Example {

    private int counter;

    public int count() {

        return counter++;
    }
}

The rule takes these cases into account and will only flag an
error if it is safe to convert the field to a local variable.
To avoid reporting false positives and slowing down testing,
the rule implementation uses inexact heuristics
for excluding certain fields from being flagged. There are a
small number of cases where OPT.CTLV will not detect a field
that could be converted to a local variable. However, this
is the tradeoff for not reporting annoying false positives.
Often, fields that are flagged by OPT.CTLV can be
completely removed, without replacing them by a local
variable. To better detect such cases, OPT.CTLV can be
combined with other rules, such as INIT.SF, INIT.CSI, UC.AUV,
and UC.AVNR.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

-Ignore fields which are used in a constructor.
    -Default is true.  This means that, by default, the rule will not flag an
     error for any field used in a constructor even if that field is not used in
     another method or constructor.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Mobile platforms have reduced resources, optimizations are especially important. 

If a field is used by only one method, you can save memory and 
system resources by moving the field to a local variable.

EXAMPLE

package examples.rules.opt;

public class CTLV {

    private int index;
    private int number;  // VIOLATION

    public CTLV (int i) {
        index = i;
    }

    public int getIndex() {
        return index;
    }

    public int getNumber() {
        return number; 
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Change the field 'number' to local variable

package examples.rules.opt;

public class CTLVFixed {

    private int index;

    public CTLVFixed(int i) {
        index = i;
    }

    public int getIndex() {
        return index;
    }

    public int getNumber() {
    int number = 12;  // FIXED
        return number; 
}
