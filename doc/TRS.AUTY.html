DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

This rule identifies the use of 'Thread.yield()'.  An error is reported for 
each occurrence.

category: Deadlocks and Race Conditions

The 'Thread.yield()' method is often used within processor intensive loops to
yield execution to other threads.  However, since there is no guarantee how
the 'Thread.yield()' method will be implemented on different virtual machines,
this may not work as intended.  On many Java Virtual Machines, the 'Thread.yield()'
method is simply implemented as a no-op.  If this is the case, the machine may
hang if you are relying on the 'Thread.yield()' method to control thread execution. 


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

'Thread.yield()' has no predictable impact on the behavior of an application
when run under different virtual machines.  If you are depending on yielding
as a source of liveness or safety, then you have no guarantee that
your program will always work.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This method changes the scheduling of your program, so it may be useful during
testing to insert calls to 'Thread.yield()' to try to break your program by
exercising more possible execution orders.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Avoid using 'Thread.yield()'.  Try to minimize the number of concurrently running 
threads.
