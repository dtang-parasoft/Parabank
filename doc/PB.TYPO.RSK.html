DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is designed to detect duplicate "getter" or "setter" methods.  It 
will flag a violation for any case where the programmer attempts to define a
"getter" or "setter" method for a field which already has a "getter" or "setter"
method.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For purposes of this rule, a "getter" method is defined to be a method whose 
name starts with "get" which has a single statement.  This statement must be a
"return" statement, and the returned value must be a field for the method to be 
considered a "getter" method.  A "setter" method is defined to be a method whose 
name starts with "set" which has a single statement.  This statement must be an
assignment statement, and the return value must be void for the method to 
be considered a "getter" method.  Also, the assignment must be made to a field.

PARAMETERS

<PRE>

-Ignore overriding and implementing methods.
    -Default value is false.
    -If this box is checked, methods that override a method defined in a 
     superclass or implement a method declared as abstract in an interface will
     not be looked at when checking for duplicate "getter"/"setter" methods.
-Allow multiple "setter" methods if the parameter types are different.  (Default 
 value is false.)
-Allow multiple "getter" methods if the return types are different.  (Default  
 value is false.)

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If there is more than one method that gets or sets the same field, it is likely
a bug.  It is likely that the programmer meant for one of the "getter" or 
"setter" methods to access or set another field.  This can easily happen when
copying and pasting code.
